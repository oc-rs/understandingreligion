# Introduction

Are you passionate about sharing your knowledge of religious traditions? We need your help to make religious literacy more accessible!

We're looking for article writers, proof readers, and bug hunters.

# Article writing

## Potential topics

At the moment we’re open to any articles on pretty much any religious topic that you're interested in writing about - from academic theories and biographies of scholars, to explanation of religious concepts, language, practices, etc.

You could also expand an already existing page if you feel like it's missing content (many of our articles probably fall into this category!).

It's worth getting in touch before committing to any content to make sure it's something we'd be able to use.

## Style

The style should be conversational, informative, and neutral - as the site is an academic resource we’re not trying to argue for the truth (or untruth) of any particular subject, just to present the facts.

Smaller paragraphs and frequent headings are helpful for improving readability.

Where possible, references should be included so that a wide audience can understand the topic.

You're welcome (even encouraged!) to include images and videos, or provide links to further reading elsewhere online.

## Copyright

The site is made available under a creative commons license - Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) - which means that anything posted can be shared and remixed by anyone, provided they provide attribution back to the original source.

Naturally you'd be created in-page for any articles you write, and you'd be free to post the same material elsewhere under the terms of the copyright licence.

## Submitting your work

If you have something you'd like to share the easiest way to get it to us is by email (hello@ocrs.online), but you could also share a Google Doc, a link to Github repo, or really anything - it's the 21st century, go nuts.

If you know how to write using Markdown, that would be ideal, but to be honest any text format is fine.

We might have to do a bit of editorial work on anything you submit, just to make sure everything is in line with the rest of the site.

# Proof reading and bug hunting

A lot of the articles on the site at the moment are either placeholders or in need of review, so if you would prefer a more editorial role you could point out errors, typos, or stylistic issues - each page has a 'report' button at the bottom of the screen you can use to quickly send a response if you notice something amiss.

If you’re more into the technical side of things and you find a dodgy link, badly formatted code, or something else unusual please let us know.

# Payment

I’m afraid we cannot pay for any work that you submit or offer - the site does not generate any income and is produced on a volunteer basis.

# Getting in touch

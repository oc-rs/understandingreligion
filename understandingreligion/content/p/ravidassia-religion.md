## Introduction

The Ravidassia religion is a distinct faith that emerged from the teachings of Guru Ravidass, a 14th-century Indian saint and social reformer. Known for advocating equality and social justice, Guru Ravidass's teachings resonate strongly within the Dalit community, emphasizing the worship of one supreme God and the rejection of caste discrimination.

## Historical Background

### Life of Guru Ravidas

Guru Ravidas, born in 1377 CE in Varanasi, India, was a prominent spiritual leader and reformer. He belonged to the leather-working Chamar caste, traditionally considered untouchable in the Hindu caste hierarchy. Despite facing significant social discrimination, Guru Ravidas gained a following due to his profound spiritual insights and egalitarian teachings.

### Emergence of the Ravidassia Faith

The Ravidassia religion formally emerged in the early 21st century, distinguishing itself from Sikhism. This separation was catalyzed by the assassination of Ravidassia leader Sant Ramanand in 2009, which prompted the community to assert a distinct religious identity. The establishment of separate religious symbols, scriptures, and places of worship marked the formalization of the Ravidassia faith.

## Beliefs and Teachings

### Core Beliefs

1. **Monotheism**: Ravidassia adherents believe in one supreme God, referred to as "Satguru" or "Onkar."
2. **Equality**: The faith emphasizes the inherent equality of all human beings, rejecting caste-based discrimination.
3. **Personal Salvation**: Ravidassia teachings focus on attaining spiritual liberation through devotion, ethical living, and selfless service.

### The Amritbani Guru Ravidass Ji

The central scripture of the Ravidassia religion is the "Amritbani Guru Ravidass Ji," a collection of Guru Ravidass's hymns and teachings. This text serves as a spiritual guide for adherents, emphasizing themes of devotion, justice, and equality.

## Practices and Rituals

### Places of Worship

Ravidassia temples, known as "Bhavans" or "Gurdwaras," are central to community worship. These temples host regular congregational prayers, recitations of the Amritbani, and communal meals (Langar) that embody the principle of equality.

### Festivals

Significant festivals in the Ravidassia calendar include the birth anniversary of Guru Ravidass, celebrated with great enthusiasm. This event, known as "Guru Ravidass Jayanti," features processions, prayers, and cultural performances, highlighting the community's devotion and cultural heritage.

## Modern Developments

### Global Presence

The Ravidassia community has a significant global presence, particularly in countries with large Indian diasporas, such as the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States. International Ravidassia organizations work to promote the teachings of Guru Ravidass and support the social and spiritual needs of the community.

### Social Impact

The Ravidassia faith continues to play a crucial role in advocating for the rights and dignity of Dalits in India. Through social initiatives and religious teachings, the Ravidassia community strives to combat caste-based discrimination and promote social justice.

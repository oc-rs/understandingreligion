# Introduction
The Sámi people, indigenous to the northern regions of Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Russia's Kola Peninsula, possess a rich cultural heritage deeply intertwined with their natural environment. Central to this heritage is their indigenous religion, which reflects their deep connection to the land, animals, and spiritual world. This article explores the main aspects of Sámi indigenous religion, presenting the facts in an accessible and informative manner.

# Historical Context
The Sámi are the only indigenous people recognized in the European Union, with a history that stretches back thousands of years. Traditionally, they have been reindeer herders, fishermen, and hunters, with their spiritual practices evolving alongside their lifestyle. Despite centuries of Christian influence, particularly from the 17th century onwards, many traditional beliefs and practices have endured.

# Central Beliefs
## Animism and Shamanism
At the heart of Sámi religion is animism, the belief that all natural objects and phenomena possess a spirit. This includes animals, plants, rocks, lakes, and other elements of the natural world. Central to this belief system is the concept of a shaman, known as a "noaidi." The noaidi acted as a mediator between the human and spirit worlds, performing rituals, healing the sick, and ensuring the community’s well-being through their connection with the spiritual realm.

## The Worldview
The Sámi worldview is traditionally divided into three realms:
* The Upper World (Yliminen): Home to the gods and benevolent spirits.
* The Middle World (Keskinen): The physical world inhabited by humans and animals.
* The Underworld (Alinen): A realm of the dead and malevolent spirits.

These realms are interconnected, and the noaidi would journey between them during trance states induced by drumming, chanting, and sometimes the use of psychoactive substances.

# Deities and Spirits
## Key Deities
The Sámi pantheon includes numerous gods and goddesses, each associated with aspects of nature and human life. Some of the principal deities are:
* Máttaráhkká: The mother goddess, associated with childbirth and motherhood.
* Beaivi: The sun goddess, vital for the growth of plants and the health of reindeer.
* Horagállis: The god of thunder, who was believed to protect against evil spirits and natural disasters.

## Nature Spirits
Alongside these deities, the Sámi also believed in a host of spirits associated with natural features:
* Seita: Sacred stones or other natural formations where spirits were thought to reside. These sites were used for offerings and rituals.
* Radien-attje and Radien-pardne: Sky spirits who played important roles in the creation myths and daily life.

# Rituals and Practices
## Drumming and Yoiking
One of the most distinctive elements of Sámi spiritual practice is the use of the drum. The drum was not merely a musical instrument but a sacred tool used by the noaidi to enter trance states and communicate with the spirit world. The drum's surface often featured intricate symbols representing various spiritual and natural elements.

Yoiking, a traditional form of singing, also played a crucial role. Each yoik was a melodic expression associated with a person, animal, or place, believed to capture its essence and spirit. This form of singing remains a vital cultural expression among the Sámi today.

## Seasonal Festivals
The Sámi calendar included several festivals aligned with the natural cycles, particularly those of the reindeer. Key celebrations included:
* The Spring Festival: Marking the return of the sun and the beginning of the reindeer calving season.
* The Autumn Festival: Associated with the reindeer slaughter and preparation for winter, involving communal feasting and rituals to ensure prosperity.

# Christianity and Syncretism
From the 17th century onwards, intense Christian missionary activity sought to eradicate Sámi indigenous practices. Churches were built, and many noaidi were persecuted. However, the Sámi displayed remarkable resilience, often blending Christian elements with their traditional beliefs, leading to a syncretic form of spirituality that persists in some communities.

# Contemporary Practice and Revival
In recent decades, there has been a significant revival of interest in Sámi culture and religion. Efforts to preserve and revitalize traditional practices are ongoing, supported by cultural organizations and increased scholarly attention. Today, many Sámi balance their traditional spiritual beliefs with modern lifestyles, celebrating their heritage through festivals, music, and education.

# Conclusion
The Sámi indigenous religion is a testament to the enduring connection between a people and their environment. Through animism, shamanism, and a rich pantheon of deities and spirits, the Sámi have maintained a vibrant spiritual tradition that continues to evolve. Understanding this religion offers valuable insights into the Sámi way of life and their profound respect for nature.

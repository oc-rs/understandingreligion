## Introduction

The Filipino author José Rizal, who lived during the late 19th century, was a prominent nationalist voice in a period where the Philippine public was pushing for independence from their colonial rulers, Spain. Although he was not personally involved in the Philippine Revolution, his writings were nonetheless found to have been too controversial, contributing in part to the revolution, and he was therefore executed by the Spanish.

Rizal has since been elevated to the status of national hero amongst the Philippines, but for some his importance goes further, and they believe that his non-violent message of love and independence, rooted in Christianity and terminated by execution, was part of a second coming of Jesus Christ – others identify him with a pre-Spanish deity, or consider him a prophet.

There are a variety of religious groups inspired by Rizal, which are collectively referred to as Rizalism, Rizalist cults, or Rizalista religious movements, an example of which is the Iglesia Watawat Ng Lahi (Church of the Banner of the Race).

## Historical Context

### José Rizal's Influence

José Rizal's influence extends beyond his literary contributions, such as the novels "Noli Me Tangere" and "El Filibusterismo," which criticized Spanish colonial rule and the Catholic Church's power in the Philippines. His martyrdom turned him into a symbol of resistance and an inspiration for the Philippine Revolution. Rizal's execution in 1896 by Spanish authorities made him a martyr, cementing his status as a national hero.

### Rise of Rizalism

After his death, various religious movements began to emerge, interpreting Rizal's life and works through a spiritual lens. These movements, collectively known as Rizalism, view Rizal not just as a hero, but as a divine figure or prophet. This deification process was fueled by a combination of indigenous beliefs, Catholicism, and the socio-political context of the time.

## Core Beliefs

### Divine Manifestation

Many Rizalist groups believe that José Rizal was a divine incarnation or a prophet. Some view him as the second coming of Jesus Christ, while others link him to pre-colonial Filipino deities. This belief system blends Christianity with indigenous Filipino spirituality, creating a unique religious synthesis.

### Non-Violence and Love

Rizal's teachings emphasize non-violence, love, and education as the path to national and personal liberation. These principles are central to Rizalist doctrines, reflecting Rizal's own advocacy for peaceful reform rather than violent revolution.

## Rizalist Movements

### Iglesia Watawat Ng Lahi

The Iglesia Watawat Ng Lahi (Church of the Banner of the Race) is one of the prominent Rizalist groups. Founded in 1936, this movement venerates Rizal as a divine figure and incorporates rituals and beliefs that reflect his teachings. The church's practices include regular services that honor Rizal's memory and promote his messages of peace and enlightenment.

### Other Rizalist Groups

There are several other Rizalist movements, each with its own interpretations and practices. These groups often combine elements of Christianity with indigenous Filipino traditions, creating diverse expressions of Rizalism. Some notable groups include:
- **Samahan ng Tatlong Persona Solo Dios**: This group emphasizes the trinity of God, Jesus Christ, and José Rizal.
- **Bathalismo**: A movement that blends Rizalism with native animistic beliefs, considering Rizal as a god-like figure.

## Rituals and Practices

### Worship Services

Rizalist worship services typically involve prayers, hymns, and readings from Rizal's writings. These gatherings serve as a means of communal reflection on Rizal's teachings and their application to daily life.

### Festivals and Celebrations

Rizalists celebrate important dates related to José Rizal's life, such as his birth (June 19) and his martyrdom (December 30). These events are marked with ceremonies that include processions, reenactments of his life events, and public readings of his works.

## Contemporary Relevance

### Social and Political Impact

Rizalist movements continue to play a role in Philippine society, offering a sense of identity and community for their members. These groups often engage in social and political activities, advocating for education, social justice, and national pride in line with Rizal's ideals.

### Challenges and Criticisms

Rizalism faces challenges both from mainstream religious institutions and the broader secular society. Critics argue that the deification of Rizal may obscure his true contributions as a nationalist and reformer. Additionally, Rizalist groups often navigate the complexities of maintaining their distinct beliefs in a predominantly Catholic country.

## Conclusion

Rizalism represents a unique blend of nationalism, spirituality, and cultural identity, centered around the figure of José Rizal. These movements honor Rizal not only as a national hero but also as a spiritual guide, embodying principles of non-violence, love, and enlightenment. Understanding Rizalism offers a deeper appreciation of the diverse ways in which Rizal's legacy continues to inspire and shape the Philippines.

# Introduction

The Filipino author José Rizal, who lived during the late 19th century, was a prominent nationalist voice in a period where the Philippine public was pushing for independence from their colonial rulers, Spain. Although he was not personally involved in the Philippine Revolution, his writings were nonetheless found to have been too controversial, contributing in part to the revolution, and he was therefore executed by the Spanish.

Rizal has since been elevated to the status of national hero amongst the Philippines, but for some his importance goes further, and they believe that his non-violent message of love and independence, rooted in [Christianity](/p/christianity/) and terminated by execution, was part of a second coming of [Jesus Christ](/p/jesus/) – others identify him with a pre-Spanish deity, or consider him a prophet.

There are a variety of religious groups inspired by Rizal, which are collectively referred to as Rizalism, Rizalist cults, or Rizalista religious movements, an example of which is the *Iglesia Watawat Ng Lahi* (Church of the Banner of the Race).

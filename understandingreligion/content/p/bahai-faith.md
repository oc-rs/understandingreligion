# Introduction 
For the Bah√°‚Äô√≠ Faith, there is only one deity, and it is responsible for the creation, maintenance, and dissolution of the world.

They call this deity Bah√°.

Bah√° is a personal deity, who is aware of the activities of the world, and sends messengers and prophets to communicate on its behalf. Of particular note is that Bah√°‚Äô√≠s consider many religious figures from other traditions to be legitimate representatives of Bah√° - for example Jesus, Muhammad, and Gautama Buddha.

Because these revelations and messages are tailored to suit the time and place in which they are shared, there is a progressive nature to religion, and Bah√°‚Äôs end goal is a unified, peaceful world free from persecution and hatred.

# Introduction
Buddhism is a family of traditions which trace their lineage back to a figure known as Siddartha Gautama, a man who discovered a means of escape from the suffering of existence. It is said that he became 'awakened', and this is the meaning of his title: Buddha.

Broadly speaking, Buddhists follow the Four Noble Truths, as expressed by the Buddha:

* Suffering exists
* Suffering has a cause, craving / desire
* Suffering has an end, if craving is stopped
* The Noble Eightfold Path is the route to the cessation of suffering

Although most Buddhists would agree that these principles are true, how they follow the Buddhaâ€™s teachings, and their relationship to other teachers and entities is very diverse.

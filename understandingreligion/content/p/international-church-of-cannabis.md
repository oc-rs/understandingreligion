# Introduction
The International Church of Cannabis is a religious group based in Denver, Colorado, USA, which uses cannabis during its ceremonies in order to help members have a better understanding of themselves.

The church is unaffiliated with any other religious traditions, but its members are not restricted in any way - the church is viewed as a supplement to, rather than a replacement for, a personâ€™s religious identity.

>...there is no need to convert to Elevationism. It claims no divine law, no unquestionable doctrine, and no authoritarian structure.

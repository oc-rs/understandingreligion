## Introduction
The International Church of Cannabis is a religious group based in Denver, Colorado, USA, which uses cannabis during its ceremonies in order to help members have a better understanding of themselves.

The church is unaffiliated with any other religious traditions, but its members are not restricted in any way - the church is viewed as a supplement to, rather than a replacement for, a personâ€™s religious identity.

Elevationism is a modern spiritual movement that intertwines religious practice with the use of cannabis. Originating in the 21st century, Elevationism posits that cannabis can be a sacrament, aiding in personal and spiritual growth by elevating the mind and spirit. This movement aims to provide a closer connection to the divine through the psychoactive effects of cannabis.

## Origins and Beliefs

### Foundation

Elevationism was founded by Steve Berke and other cannabis advocates who saw the potential of the plant in spiritual contexts. The International Church of Cannabis, established in Denver, Colorado, in 2017, serves as the movement's central hub. The church is both a place of worship and a community center for those who share these beliefs.

### Core Tenets

1. **Cannabis as a Sacrament**: Elevationists believe that cannabis is a tool for spiritual growth and personal insight. The psychoactive effects of cannabis are seen as a way to elevate consciousness and facilitate a deeper connection to one's inner self and the universe.

2. **Personal Spirituality**: Elevationism does not adhere to a rigid set of doctrines. Instead, it encourages personal spirituality and the exploration of one's own path. The movement is inclusive, welcoming individuals from various religious backgrounds and beliefs.

3. **Community and Fellowship**: Community is a vital aspect of Elevationism. The International Church of Cannabis and similar organizations provide spaces for members to gather, share experiences, and support one another in their spiritual journeys.

## Practices

### Services and Rituals

Elevationist services often include communal cannabis consumption, meditation, and discussions on spiritual topics. These gatherings aim to create a supportive environment where individuals can explore their spirituality while experiencing the effects of cannabis.

### Art and Expression

Art plays a significant role in Elevationism. The International Church of Cannabis, for example, features vibrant murals and art installations that reflect the movement's values and the transformative power of cannabis. These artistic expressions are intended to inspire and elevate the minds of those who visit.

## Controversies and Legal Issues

### Legal Challenges

Elevationism faces various legal challenges due to the complex legal status of cannabis. While cannabis use is legal in some areas, it remains prohibited in others. This creates a challenging landscape for Elevationist communities, particularly in regions where cannabis use is heavily regulated or banned.

### Social Perception

The movement also grapples with social stigma associated with cannabis use. Despite growing acceptance and legalization, many still view cannabis negatively, complicating the public perception of Elevationism as a legitimate spiritual practice.

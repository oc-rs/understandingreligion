# Introduction
>I am an anthropologist and cognitive scientist studying ritual, cooperation, and some of the things that make us human.
>
>After receiving my PhD from the Institute of Cognition and Culture at Queenâ€™s University Belfast, I held positions at the universities of Princeton, Aarhus, and Masaryk, where I served as Director of the Laboratory for the Experimental Research of Religion (LEVYNA). In 2014, I joined the University of Connecticut, where I direct the Experimental Anthropology Lab.
>
>For my research, I combine scientific methods and technologies with ethnographic fieldwork. I have conducted several years of field work in Southern Europe and Mauritius, studying the psychological and social effects of extreme rituals and developing a methodology for studying such rituals experimentally in their natural context.
>
>Before becoming a full-time academic, I worked as a translator, photographer, and book editor (and of course a waiter).

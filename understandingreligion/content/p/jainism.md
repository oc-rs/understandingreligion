# Introduction
The Jain religious tradition focuses on liberation from the suffering of rebirth, and in this sense has common ground with its near geographic neighbours - Hinduism and Buddhism. For Jains, karma is an accretion of negative energy, collected over many lives - like pollen clinging to the legs of a bee. The goal of human life is to shed this karma, and once free from it, achieve supreme liberation - moksha.

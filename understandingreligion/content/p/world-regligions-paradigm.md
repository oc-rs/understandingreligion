# Introduction
When the category of religion is used to describe 'world religions', it is often in a way that turns multiple diverse traditions, philosophies, and practices, into one single entity for the sake of simplicity.

A good example of this is [Hinduism](/p/hinduism/), which is a label coined by the British to describe the religion of the Indian people.

<p class="title is-4">The hidden diversity of Hinduism</p>
<p class="content">
Hinduism did not exist in the language of the Indian peoples (in fact there are many languages in use on the Indian subcontinent); it was a label applied by British observers.
</p>
<p class="content">
There are many different religious traditions in India that are viewed as subdivisions <em>within Hinduism</em>, but this shared definition does not mean that all Hindus believe the same things or practice in the same way.
</p>
<p class="content">
Of course, Hinduism (as a category) has been in use for so long now that many Hindus are perfectly happy using it to describe their religious affiliation, but not all feel the same way, and it is a good example of the sort of effect that using alien terminology can have when describing a culture other than one's own. The scope for misunderstanding is wide, and it is easy to make mistakes that have repercussions for hundreds of years.

# Recognising difference
The issue remains that it is far too easy to talk about 'religion X' as though it is one single group of people, who all believe the same things and act the same way â€“ but this is clearly not true.

In Europe and North America, most people have grown up with exposure to the differences between Christian denominations (certainly the differences between Catholic and Protestant forms of worship). This nuanced understanding is less widespread when it comes to traditions that are not native to one's culture, or with which one has less experience.

In other words, the less you know about a religious tradition, the easier it is to make generalisations and assumptions. If we take these generalisations to be fact, then we're in dangerous territory.

# Who makes the cut?
In addition to smoothing over subtle differences within a religious tradition, the designation of something as a 'World Religion' is also often used to *restrict* what counts as a religion. Many people have inherited a list of the 'big players' like Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Judaism, and Hinduism.

However, this approach ignores a vast range of religious systems, especially indigenous traditions.

It ignores, and encourages others to ignore, many vibrant and diverse expressions of human religiosity.

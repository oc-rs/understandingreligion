Title: "Ritual"
Abstract: "Some religious practices have specific rules about how they are performed, these practices are sometimes called rituals. There is no hard line between 'religious practice' and 'ritual', but practices with more rules can be described as more ritualistic."

## Rituals or ritualised practice?
Religious practices include a wide variety of activity, but in some cases these practices might be described as rituals, a term that carries many conflicting associations; however, it’s possible to see ritual as a *type* of religious practice, which pays attention to not only what is done, but also the broader context in which the action is situated. In other words, rituals are religious practices with some degree of specificity that separates them from ‘everyday’ religious activities.

This definition finds common ground with a dictionary definition, which describes ritual as ‘[a] religious or solemn ceremony consisting of a series of actions performed according to a prescribed order’ (Oxford University Press, 2018). This sense of ritual as a mechanism of order and control recurs in a variety of contexts, but we should be wary of making things too simple; [Catherine Bell](/p/catherine-bell/) (2006) points out that ‘...scholars may be at the point of relinquishing the idea that there can be a single theory of ritual, for ritual may not be any one thing.’

We can start to appreciate the differences between ritual and non-ritual religious practices by considering diet. For many people, choosing what food to eat is a decision based on their religious culture and beliefs, but isn’t actually a ritual.

Jewish dietary law ([kashrut](/p/kashrut/)), requires that only foods of appropriate types can be consumed; these appropriate foods are described as [kosher](/p/kosher/), suitable for consumption. However, the decision to eat (or not) in accordance with kashrut doesn’t appear to be ritualistic; it isn’t ceremonial, and although the prescribed foods suggest a sense of order, kashrut doesn’t dictate where, when, or how a meal is eaten.

By contrast, the slaughter of animals for consumption could be described as a ritual because it involves a deliberate action by an authorised person (in the case of Jewish slaughter, this person is called a shochet) with prescribed methods, intentions, and outcomes. In Judaism, this ritual slaughter is known as [shechita](/p/shechita/), although the British organisation Shechita UK doesn’t consider the act a ritual, and instead describes the process in medical terms, focusing on the claimed humaneness of the method. You can read their comments here: http://shechitauk.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/A_Guide_to_Shechita_2009__01.pdf

An interesting overlap between ritual and non-ritual practice is found in the act of eating. Making the opening remarks at the Shoresh Food Conference (a Jewish event), Risa Alyson Cooper questions whether it’s enough for Jews to eat kosher foods, or whether they should introduce additional (ritual) behaviour: 

>‘Does eating Jewishly mean creating space for the divine at our tables? Does it mean acknowledging the role of an ultimate Creator, an [sic] unifying energy or breath of life?  Does it mean saying a blessing, expressions of gratitude?’

The activities that Cooper describes (creating space for, and acknowledging, the divine) would shift the act of eating further into the realm of ritual, creating a more deliberate approach to consumption, a better sense of order, and clearer outcomes (appreciation and gratitude among the eaters).

This exploration also hints that the boundary between ritual and non-ritual may be permeable – in other words actions might move between ritual and non-ritual depending on a variety of factors including what the action is, why it’s performed, how it’s done, where, when, and with whom. Every aspect of a practice can influence how that practice is experienced and perceived, and create boundaries in the social and emotional lives of religious practitioners.

Watch the video below, which features a talk on ritual delivered by [Dimitris Xygalatas](/p/dimitris-xygalatas/) - pay attention to what he suggests about the function of ritual, and the form it usually takes.

Boundaries, and their utility, according to Dimitris Xygalatas, form the basis of ritual; rituals create a sense of order which contrasts with the more common experience of disorder. He notes that rituals can function as methods of mitigating the stress that comes with uncertainty: ‘We see that the more stressed [experimental participants] get, the more repetitive, rigid, and redundant their hand movements become; in other words, the more stressed they get, the more ritualised their behaviour’.

The sense that ritual involves formalism (strict rules about behaviour) is found across a variety of religious contexts, but is ritual behaviour just rigid and repetitive? In the next lesson we'll take a closer look.

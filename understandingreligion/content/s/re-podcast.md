# Introduction
>Each episode is twenty minutes long and will offer stories, statistics, religious teaching, and opinions on a specific topic. We will also interview people from some of the world's major religions (and perhaps even those that have opinions on religion, without being religious themselves). Who knows, you might even find it entertaining, too!

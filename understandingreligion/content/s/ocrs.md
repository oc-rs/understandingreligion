# Introduction   
The OCRS was founded by Luke Burns in 2016 as a way to help provide access to information about religious ideas and practices from around the world.

> I wanted to learn about different perspectives and experiences of the unseen, but struggled to find a place online that offered this information in a clear and accessible format. I imagined creating an organisation that would provide this knowledge, and little by little tried to bring it into existence.

Since its founding, the OCRS has published two online courses, a number of blog posts, and created the website Understanding Religion.

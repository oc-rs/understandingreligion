# Introduction
A live recording of an online talk and Q+A via zoom on 21st October 2020 for the SOAS Centre of Yoga Studies.

>This presentation by Shaman Hatley builds upon earlier research, where he argued that yoginī temples mark the entry of these goddesses into a wider religious domain, beyond the confines of the earlier esoteric tradition, bridging the ritual worlds of tantra and purāṇa.

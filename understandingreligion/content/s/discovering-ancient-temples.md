Abstract = "In this course we learn about Hinduism through the prism of archaeology. We explore the multiple identities of sacred sites and how these are negotiated. We learn how archaeology can uncover changes in ritual, transformations in diet, and changes in how sacred spaces are used. The texts tell us only part of the story, the stones tell their own tales."

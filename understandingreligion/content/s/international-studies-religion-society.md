Title: International Studies in Religion and Society
Abstract: "International Studies in Religion and Society publishes about societal themes and their relation to religion from a social scientific point of view, also taking into account approaches from contemporary philosophical and legal research. The seriesâ€™ aim is making contributions to the development of theories on the interplay between religion and society by focussing on a deeper understanding of different systems of thought, values and belief, and the ways in which these systems interact."

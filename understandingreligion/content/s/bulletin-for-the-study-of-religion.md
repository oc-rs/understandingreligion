Title: Bulletin for the Study of Religion
Abstract: The Bulletin began life in 1971 as the CSSR Bulletin. The journal publishes articles that address religion in general, the history of the field of religious studies, method and theory in the study of religion, and pedagogical practices. The Bulletin is unique in that it offers a forum for various academic voices to debate and reflect on the ever-changing state of the field, and insofar as it encourages scholars continually to engage meta-level questions at the leading edge of inquiry.

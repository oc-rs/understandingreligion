# Hi! Nice to meet you :)
I like buying too many books and learning about people's religious and philosophical worldviews.

In 2016 I founded the Online Centre for Religious Studies, an organisation that aims to make religious studies accessible for a wide audience, without hiding anything behind specialist language. I was in part inspired by the way that open source programming documentation is often written in a clear, open, and friendly style, without sacrificing detail or meaning.

I spent several years working on the OCRS, creating an introductory online course, and completing my undergradutate studies with the Open University.

In 2020 I achieved a First Class Honours Degree in Humanties, with a focus on Religious Studies. I am now working to create a comprehensive online resource for learning about religion and worldviews: <span style="color: #1c768f">Understanding Religion</span>.

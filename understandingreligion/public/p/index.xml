      <description>Introduction Although the word &amp;lsquo;texts&amp;rsquo; might imply a written document, the term has a wider scope in the field of religious studies. We can consider four categories of texts:
 Written documents. The most easily recognised form of text, for example the Bible or the Qur&amp;rsquo;an. Though often considered &amp;lsquo;fixed&amp;rsquo; and unchanging, written texts are frequently altered and edited over long periods, and alternate versions of the same text are sometimes purged to create the image of uniformity.</description>

      <description>Introduction The International Church of Cannabis is a religious group based in Denver, Colorado, USA, which uses cannabis during its ceremonies in order to help members have a better understanding of themselves.
The church is unaffiliated with any other religious traditions, but its members are not restricted in any way - the church is viewed as a supplement to, rather than a replacement for, a personâ€™s religious identity.

      <description>Introduction Within the Sikh religion, one of the important practical aspects is seva or selfless service, which takes the form of charitable actions.
One of the primary barriers between Sikhs and God is haumai or self-centredness, which prevents the individual from realising their dependence on Waheguru. Seva therefore serves multiple purposes: helping those in the community, building charitable networks, and undermining any grandiose ideas of self-importance.
One example of seva in practice is langar, a shared meal where all visitors to the Gurdwara eat together sitting on the floor, with no regard to hierarchy or background.</description>

      <description>Introduction Communities can be inward looking, or reach out to the wider world.
Religion not only involves beliefs and practices, it also generally involves participation in a community, which provides a sense of belonging and identity for adherents.
Community can take an institutional form, for instance membership in a church congregation, or it can be a sense of belonging to a less organised, wider group, like the Islamic ummah or community, which includes Muslims from all backgrounds, nations, and theological schools.</description>

      <description>Introduction Hassan al-Banna, the founder of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, is alternately praised as a leading social reformer, and decried as laying the foundations for modern Islamic terrorist groups.
Active during the 1920s, &amp;rsquo;30s, and &amp;rsquo;40s (until his assassination), al-Banna was focused on improving the circumstances of Egyptian society, as well as other nations in the region, and believed that by instituting reforms grounded in Islamic tradition, he would be able to steer people towards more rewarding lives.</description>

      <description>Introduction A figure of Indian independence against British rule, Gandhi was a revered Hindu activist.
Controversial Practices There are several elements of Mohandas Gandhi&amp;rsquo;s life that have led to disagreement and controversy, both during his life and after; of particular interest are the conflicted perceptions of his Hinduism and Hindu identity.
Gandhi&amp;rsquo;s particular expression of spirituality was rooted in the Hindu traditions of his family, but he also gained exposure to a variety of other religious systems, and his attitudes towards Muslims and other minority groups (for example widows, and those in the Dalit caste) did not align with many in his society (Beckerlegge, 2013, pp.</description>

      <description>Introduction The PaÃ±cadaÅ›Ä« is a Hindu philosophical text, in the tradition of advaita vedanta, also known as non-dualism.
The meaning of â€˜advaitaâ€™ is found in the word itself: a meaning not (just like in English if we say that someone is an atheist or atypical) and dvaita meaning dual. The duality referred to by this term is not just one duality, but all dualities, all apparent separation and distinction. In simple terms we might say that the advaitic position is: â€˜all things are really one thingâ€™, or â€˜itâ€™s all oneâ€™.</description>

      <description>Escaping suffering Within the Indian family of religious beliefs (understood broadly as Hinduism), one of the prominent areas of concern is moksha, or liberation from suffering (and the cycle of rebirth). This emphasis on liberation emerges from the Hindu concept of rebirth, and the cyclical nature of time, which leads one into repetitious patterns of ignorant and painful behaviour over many lifetimes. In light of this, Hindu religious philosophy has attempted to clarify methods of release from samsara â€“ the rounds of birth and death â€“ and these methods can be classified according to a tripartite schema: the trimarga.</description>

      <title>What makes a place sacred?</title>

      <guid>https://www.understandingreligion.org.uk/p/what-makes-a-place-sacred/</guid>
      <description>To claim that a location, structure, or geographical feature is sacred is to assert that it is â€˜&amp;hellip;set apart and regarded with special reverence&amp;hellip;â€™ (Wolffe, 2017(a), p.213). Yet there are many ways to understand this sacrality, where it comes from, and how it is expressed by different groups of people. The term sacred has a strong religious association, and usually means that something serves a religious function, or holds importance for people by virtue of its religious associations (Oxford University Press, 2017).</description>

      <description>Rituals or ritualised practice? Religious practices include a wide variety of activity, but in some cases these practices might be described as rituals, a term that carries many conflicting associations; however, itâ€™s possible to see ritual as a type of religious practice, which pays attention to not only what is done, but also the broader context in which the action is situated. In other words, rituals are religious practices with some degree of specificity that separates them from â€˜everydayâ€™ religious activities.</description>

      <guid>https://www.understandingreligion.org.uk/p/murti/</guid>
      <description>Introduction Murtis are believed to be places of residence for the gods, who are installed in the murti during a ceremony (known as the prana pratishtha (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prana_Pratishtha)), and thereafter treated exactly the same as the deity would be treated, including feeding, bathing, and dressing them.
 A murti becomes venerable for Hindus only after it is enlivened with the spiritual energy and essence of the Deity. Because it contains the living presence of the Deity, a murti is more than a physical representation or a meditational tool.</description>

      <description>Introduction Animism is a category of religious systems in which human activity is understood within a broader context of persons and their relationships; these persons may include visible beings such as humans, animals, plants, and rocks, and non-visible beings such as spirits or ancestors.
New animism is differentiated from &amp;lsquo;old&amp;rsquo; animism by its focus on relational ontologies - ways of being in the world which hinge on relationships, thus taking a more nuanced approach to the subject than historical efforts, which typically centered on the belief in souls which inhabit material bodies and natural phenomena.</description>

      <description>Believing in the unseen One of the most prominent and well-known aspects of religion in the Western world is faith. This term often comes with a variety of associated meanings and implications, but at its root we can say that faith involves belief in a set of doctrines or creeds which provide meaning and direction, often in the absence of empirical evidence.
Since the relationship between religious belief and scientific empiricism has often been contentious, it&amp;rsquo;s worthwhile looking a little more closely at how people believe in things, and what this means.</description>

      <description>Jesus was born sometime near the beginning of the common era, around the year 4CE, in a region known as Galilee (modern Israel).
Before he was born, an angel appeared to his mother and told her that she would soon give birth to a son, and that the child would be a gift from God. Since Mary was not yet married to her fiancÃ©. Joseph, this pregnancy would have been considered suspicious at best.</description>

      <guid>https://www.understandingreligion.org.uk/p/gautama-buddha/</guid>
      <description>Siddartha Gautama was born as a prince of a region called Kapilavastu (southern Nepal by today&amp;rsquo;s borders), sometime between the 6th and 4th centuries before the common era (BCE). As a prince, he was raised in a household of wealth and joy. It was not until his late twenties that he encountered suffering, finally witnessing the reality of sickness, old age, and death.
Committed to discovering a solution to these issues, he adopted the life of a monk, and symbolically cut off his long hair.</description>

      <description>The Islamic principle of Iman, or faith, is composed of six items, which Muslims are expected to believe in order to live a devout life:
 Allah - the existence of one god, who alone created and sustains the universe Angels - messengers of Allah who can communicate with humanity Holy Books - the scriptures, including the Qur&amp;rsquo;an but also elements of the Tanakh (Hebrew Bible) and the message preached by Isa (Jesus) Prophets - the messengers and prophets of Allah who came before Muhammad Day of Judgement - a day on which Allah will assess the character of each person and either send them to heaven or hell Predestination - Allah knows everything that will happen, although the common view is that humans still have free will to make choices  References to these six articles of faith are frequently made in Islamic publications - for example, take a look at this information page from the Enfield Islamic Centre&amp;rsquo;s website and see if you can find where the articles are mentioned: http://www.</description>

      <description>Introduction Buddhism is a family of traditions which trace their lineage back to a figure known as Siddartha Gautama, a man who discovered a means of escape from the suffering of existence. It is said that he became &amp;lsquo;awakened&amp;rsquo;, and this is the meaning of his title: Buddha.
Broadly speaking, Buddhists follow the Four Noble Truths, as expressed by the Buddha:
 Suffering exists Suffering has a cause, craving / desire Suffering has an end, if craving is stopped The Noble Eightfold Path is the route to the cessation of suffering  Although most Buddhists would agree that these principles are true, how they follow the Buddhaâ€™s teachings, and their relationship to other teachers and entities is very diverse.</description>

      <description>The first step in the study of any subject is to define our terms, draw a line around the area weâ€™re interested in, and decide how weâ€™ll investigate.
Just like any other subject, the method of investigation will influence the type of results we achieve.
To borrow a metaphor from the world of science: if we use a telescope, we only see things that are large and far away; if we use a microscope, we only see things that are small and close.</description>

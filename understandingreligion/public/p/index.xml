      <description>Introduction For the Bahá’í Faith, there is only one deity, and it is responsible for the creation, maintenance, and dissolution of the world.&#xA;They call this deity Bahá.&#xA;Bahá is a personal deity, who is aware of the activities of the world, and sends messengers and prophets to communicate on its behalf. Of particular note is that Bahá’ís consider many religious figures from other traditions to be legitimate representatives of Bahá - for example Jesus, Muhammad, and Gautama Buddha.</description>

      <title>Similarity and Difference in the Study of Religion</title>
      <link>https://www.understandingreligion.org.uk/p/similarity-and-difference/</link>

      <description>In religious studies, scholars sometime swing between two extremes. Those who look for similarity in different religions lean towards the idea of a perennial philosophy – a recurring, innately human spirituality that exists prior to culture, and is then sculpted by it. Wherever you find religious expression, they would argue, if you chip away the surface labels, you&amp;rsquo;ll find the same basic experiences.&#xA;A well-known proponent of this idea was Mircea Eliade, who claimed that religious systems were windows onto the sacred, a non-normal aspect to reality which occasionally could be glimpsed, or else might break through in the form of a hierophany (literally: a divine revelation).</description>

      <description>As we enter the world of religious studies, we do so as conditioned individuals, with our own background and history, as well as the inherited values of the society within which we were raised. We cannot &amp;lsquo;get rid&amp;rsquo; of these aspects of ourselves (nor should we!), but we should try to remain aware of them.&#xA;We should also be aware that within the field of religious studies itself, we may encounter an underlying tendency to view religion as a set of beliefs, guided by canonical literature, and though beliefs and texts are common features, they are certainly not the whole story!</description>

      <title>Seven Dimensions of Religion</title>

      <guid>https://www.understandingreligion.org.uk/p/seven-dimensions-of-religion/</guid>
      <description>Introduction The seven dimensions of religion are a framework for exploring and understanding religion, developed by the Scottish scholar of religion, Ninian Smart.&#xA;Smart&amp;rsquo;s approach sidestepped the issue of agreeing on what counted as &amp;lsquo;a religion&amp;rsquo;, and instead identified types of experience and expression that were demonstrably religious or spiritual in nature.&#xA;This modular approach to religious studies facilitated a much broader scope to consider and compare spiritual traditions and artefacts from around the world that may not have aligned with a Western conception of what a religion was.</description>

      <pubDate>Tue, 10 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://www.understandingreligion.org.uk/p/liquid-religion/</guid>
      <description>Introduction In looking at religion (or religioning) in the modern world, some scholars have argued that industrial nations have tended to become less religious and more secular. The so-called secularisation theory argues that this will continue, until religion drops off and is forgotten – the roles and purposes served by religion will eventually be replaced by communities or the larger nation state.&#xA;However, the secularisation theory seems to be proven false by the complexity of religious change in contemporary societies around the world – yes, larger organised religions have seen a drop in numbers, but people don&amp;rsquo;t seem to be less religious or spiritually inclined.</description>

      <description>Introduction The Jain religious tradition focuses on liberation from the suffering of rebirth, and in this sense has common ground with its near geographic neighbours - Hinduism and Buddhism. For Jains, karma is an accretion of negative energy, collected over many lives - like pollen clinging to the legs of a bee. The goal of human life is to shed this karma, and once free from it, achieve supreme liberation - moksha.</description>

      <title>What is religious studies?</title>
      <link>https://www.understandingreligion.org.uk/p/what-is-religious-studies/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 07 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://www.understandingreligion.org.uk/p/what-is-religious-studies/</guid>
      <description>Introduction Religious studies is the academic study of religion - but what does that really mean?&#xA;It means that we use scholarly tools and techniques to investigate what religion is, how it&amp;rsquo;s performed, why it exists, and what it means for the people who practice it.&#xA;It also means looking critically at how we build up our picture of ‘religion’ - who gets to define the category? What does it include, and what does it leave out?</description>

      <guid>https://www.understandingreligion.org.uk/p/who-creates-religion/</guid>
      <description>Introduction The modern study of religion, beginning in the 19th Century, has been traditionally driven by male European scholars, who have carried their own cultural biases and assumptions - some unconscious, others less so.&#xA;Until recently, there had been little awareness of these assumptions, and this had affected the ideas and methods used by academics; naturally we will have to negotiate some of these potential pitfalls if we want to build a more comprehensive and accurate picture of religion in the modern world.</description>

      <title>The World Religions Paradigm</title>

      <guid>https://www.understandingreligion.org.uk/p/world-religions-paradigm/</guid>
      <description>Introduction When the category of religion is used to describe &amp;lsquo;world religions&amp;rsquo;, it is often in a way that turns multiple diverse traditions, philosophies, and practices, into one single entity for the sake of simplicity.&#xA;A good example of this is Hinduism, which is a label coined by the British to describe the religion of the Indian people.&#xA;The hidden diversity of Hinduism&#xA;Hinduism did not exist in the language of the Indian peoples (in fact there are many languages in use on the Indian subcontinent); it was a label applied by British observers.</description>

      <guid>https://www.understandingreligion.org.uk/p/what-is-religious-literacy/</guid>
      <description>Introduction Religious literacy is a term that has become more popular in recent years, but what exactly do we mean when we talk about it?&#xA;The word &amp;rsquo;literacy&amp;rsquo; definitely sounds like it has something to do with reading and understanding written texts - religious traditions will often (but not always!) write things down, so is religious literacy the ability to read these texts?&#xA;Nope!&#xA;Just like how being able to read is a skill that you can apply throughout your life, religious literacy is a skill that allows you to understand and interpret religious phenomena wherever you encounter them.</description>

      <guid>https://www.understandingreligion.org.uk/p/alternative-perspectives/</guid>
      <description>Introduction Alternative perspectives, due to their absence in mainstream texts and dismissal by historical scholars, are sometimes difficult to hear over the sound of traditional narratives – but this is increasingly changing for the better. Where we can open ourselves to these voices, we can improve our understanding of the history of religion, but also our understanding of contemporary religious practitioners as well.&#xA;Feminism in religion Female academic perspectives on religious literature, contesting or challenging male interpretations, have been developing over a long period of time.</description>

      <guid>https://www.understandingreligion.org.uk/p/cults/</guid>
      <description>Introduction One of the key aspects of religion – particularly in public discourse – is the relationship between &amp;lsquo;organised religion&amp;rsquo; and small groups of devotees lead by charismatic individuals, commonly referred to as cults.&#xA;The term &amp;lsquo;cult&amp;rsquo; has a somewhat negative connotation, and conjures images of people submitting to a strange and dangerous pattern of behaviour.&#xA;We can see an example of this view in the US television series American Horror Story: Cult, in which a charismatic young man leads a group of disaffected individuals on a progressively more violent campaign to gain political power.</description>

      <description>Introduction Texts (of all kinds) are controlled and mediated by people, and therefore restrictions can sometimes be made about which texts are preserved and shared, and which are ignored or destroyed. This can lead to an erasure of certain material from a religious tradition, or from the public understanding of that tradition, particularly if the material disagrees with the perspective of those in positions of power.&#xA;Writing in Introducing World Religions, Victoria Kennick Urubshurow discusses three types of erasure: literary bias, marginalised voices, and a combination of the two, where a strong focus on a particular piece or style of literature perpetuates a pre-existing social inequality (2008, p.</description>

      <description>Introduction Although the word &amp;rsquo;texts&amp;rsquo; might imply a written document, the term has a wider scope in the field of religious studies. We can consider four categories of texts:&#xA;Written documents. The most easily recognised form of text, for example the Bible or the Qur&amp;rsquo;an. Though often considered &amp;lsquo;fixed&amp;rsquo; and unchanging, written texts are frequently altered and edited over long periods, and alternate versions of the same text are sometimes purged to create the image of uniformity.</description>

      <description>Introduction The International Church of Cannabis is a religious group based in Denver, Colorado, USA, which uses cannabis during its ceremonies in order to help members have a better understanding of themselves.&#xA;The church is unaffiliated with any other religious traditions, but its members are not restricted in any way - the church is viewed as a supplement to, rather than a replacement for, a person’s religious identity.&#xA;&amp;hellip;there is no need to convert to Elevationism.</description>

      <description>Introduction Within the Sikh religion, one of the important practical aspects is seva or selfless service, which takes the form of charitable actions.&#xA;One of the primary barriers between Sikhs and God is haumai or self-centredness, which prevents the individual from realising their dependence on Waheguru. Seva therefore serves multiple purposes: helping those in the community, building charitable networks, and undermining any grandiose ideas of self-importance.&#xA;One example of seva in practice is langar, a shared meal where all visitors to the Gurdwara eat together sitting on the floor, with no regard to hierarchy or background.</description>

      <description>Introduction Communities can be inward looking, or reach out to the wider world.&#xA;Religion not only involves beliefs and practices, it also generally involves participation in a community, which provides a sense of belonging and identity for adherents.&#xA;Community can take an institutional form, for instance membership in a church congregation, or it can be a sense of belonging to a less organised, wider group, like the Islamic ummah or community, which includes Muslims from all backgrounds, nations, and theological schools.</description>

      <description>Introduction Hassan al-Banna, the founder of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, is alternately praised as a leading social reformer, and decried as laying the foundations for modern Islamic terrorist groups.&#xA;Active during the 1920s, &amp;rsquo;30s, and &amp;rsquo;40s (until his assassination), al-Banna was focused on improving the circumstances of Egyptian society, as well as other nations in the region, and believed that by instituting reforms grounded in Islamic tradition, he would be able to steer people towards more rewarding lives.</description>

      <description>Introduction The Pañcadaśī is a Hindu philosophical text, in the tradition of advaita vedanta, also known as non-dualism.&#xA;The meaning of ‘advaita’ is found in the word itself: a meaning not (just like in English if we say that someone is an atheist or atypical) and dvaita meaning dual. The duality referred to by this term is not just one duality, but all dualities, all apparent separation and distinction. In simple terms we might say that the advaitic position is: ‘all things are really one thing’, or ‘it’s all one’.</description>

      <description>Introduction Yazidism or Sharfadin (Kurdish: شه‌رفه‌دین, Êzdiyatî, Êzdîtî, Şerfedîn,‎) is a monotheistic ethnic religion that has roots in a western Iranic pre-Zoroastrian religion directly derived from the Indo-Iranian tradition, although other, less common and more outdated narratives link the religion to Zoroastrianism and even Ancient Mesopotamian Religions. Yezidism is followed by the mainly Kurmanji-speaking Yazidis and is based on belief in one God who created the world and entrusted it into the care of seven Holy Beings, known as Angels.</description>

      <description>Introduction Within the Indian family of religious beliefs (understood broadly as Hinduism), one of the prominent areas of concern is moksha, or liberation from suffering (and the cycle of rebirth). This emphasis on liberation emerges from the Hindu concept of rebirth, and the cyclical nature of time, which leads one into repetitious patterns of ignorant and painful behaviour over many lifetimes. In light of this, Hindu religious philosophy has attempted to clarify methods of release from samsara – the rounds of birth and death – and these methods can be classified according to a tripartite schema: the trimarga.</description>

      <guid>https://www.understandingreligion.org.uk/p/what-makes-a-place-sacred/</guid>
      <description>Introduction To claim that a location, structure, or geographical feature is sacred is to assert that it is &amp;lsquo;&amp;hellip;set apart and regarded with special reverence&amp;hellip;&amp;rsquo; (Wolffe, 2017(a), p.213). Yet there are many ways to understand this sacrality, where it comes from, and how it is expressed by different groups of people. The term sacred has a strong religious association, and usually means that something serves a religious function, or holds importance for people by virtue of its religious associations (Oxford University Press, 2017).</description>

      <description>Introduction Religious practices include a wide variety of activity, but in some cases these practices might be described as rituals, a term that carries many conflicting associations. We can look at ritual as a type of religious practice, which pays attention to not only what is done, but also the broader context in which the action is situated.&#xA;In other words, rituals are religious practices with some degree of specificity that separates them from ‘everyday’ religious activities.</description>

      <description>Introduction At less than a century old, the Cao Dai religion (also known as Caodaism) is arguably a New Religious Movement. It emerged in Vietnam during the 1920s and based its structure on that of the Roman Catholic Church, but drew its principles and practices from Buddhism, Daoism, Christianity, and Confucianism (religious systems all alive in Vietnam at that time).&#xA;The tradition is traced back to Ngô Văn Chiêu, a Vietnamese official in the French colonial administration, who was particularly interested in religion and spiritualism (contact with the dead).</description>

      <description>Introduction The concept of &amp;lsquo;religion&amp;rsquo; has been abstracted from observations of behaviour and experience, but no one can point to &amp;lsquo;religion&amp;rsquo; as a real thing. Instead, scholars argue, we should talk about people religioning, doing religion, behaving religiously.&#xA;This attitude towards religion sees it as a process, not a static entity, and tries to counteract the tendency to bundle complex cultural phenomena into simple ideas - this tendency, when applied to foreign cultures and traditions can be particularly damaging for our understanding of religion, and has contributed to the world religions paradigm.</description>

      <description>Introduction Mahayana is a form of Buddhism that includes many divergent traditions spread over a geographically and culturally diverse area, but can be summarised as a religion where compassion for others is the principal virtue. For Mahayanists, the aspirational figure is the bodhisattva: one who delays their own salvation in order to help others achieve liberation first.</description>

      <description>Introduction Murtis are believed to be places of residence for the gods, who are installed in the murti during a ceremony (known as the prana pratishtha (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prana_Pratishtha)), and thereafter treated exactly the same as the deity would be treated, including feeding, bathing, and dressing them.&#xA;A murti becomes venerable for Hindus only after it is enlivened with the spiritual energy and essence of the Deity. Because it contains the living presence of the Deity, a murti is more than a physical representation or a meditational tool.</description>

      <description>Introduction The Filipino author José Rizal, who lived during the late 19th century, was a prominent nationalist voice in a period where the Philippine public was pushing for independence from their colonial rulers, Spain. Although he was not personally involved in the Philippine Revolution, his writings were nonetheless found to have been too controversial, contributing in part to the revolution, and he was therefore executed by the Spanish.&#xA;Rizal has since been elevated to the status of national hero amongst the Philippines, but for some his importance goes further, and they believe that his non-violent message of love and independence, rooted in Christianity and terminated by execution, was part of a second coming of Jesus Christ – others identify him with a pre-Spanish deity, or consider him a prophet.</description>

      <description>Introduction Animism is a category of religious systems in which human activity is understood within a broader context of persons and their relationships; these persons may include visible beings such as humans, animals, plants, and rocks, and non-visible beings such as spirits or ancestors.&#xA;New animism is differentiated from &amp;lsquo;old&amp;rsquo; animism by its focus on relational ontologies - ways of being in the world which hinge on relationships, thus taking a more nuanced approach to the subject than historical efforts, which typically centered on the belief in souls which inhabit material bodies and natural phenomena.</description>

      <description>Believing in the unseen One of the most prominent and well-known aspects of religion in the Western world is faith. This term often comes with a variety of associated meanings and implications, but at its root we can say that faith involves belief in a set of doctrines or creeds which provide meaning and direction, often in the absence of empirical evidence.&#xA;Since the relationship between religious belief and scientific empiricism has often been contentious, it&amp;rsquo;s worthwhile looking a little more closely at how people believe in things, and what this means.</description>

      <description>Jesus was born sometime near the beginning of the common era, around the year 4CE, in a region known as Galilee (modern Israel).&#xA;Before he was born, an angel appeared to his mother and told her that she would soon give birth to a son, and that the child would be a gift from God. Since Mary was not yet married to her fiancé. Joseph, this pregnancy would have been considered suspicious at best.</description>

      <description>Introduction The Ramayana (literally Rama&amp;rsquo;s travels) is about the character Rama, prince of a kingdom called Ayodhya (and later its king), but Rama is actually the god Vishnu who has taken birth in a human form, or avatar. The word should be familiar to internet users, who often have an online avatar to represent them, and of course the film by the same name uses a similar idea of becoming embodied and represented by a form not belonging to one&amp;rsquo;s true self.</description>

      <description>Introduction Siddhārtha Gautama was born as a prince of a region called Kapilavastu (southern Nepal by today&amp;rsquo;s borders), sometime between the 6th and 4th centuries before the common era (BCE). As a prince, he was raised in a household of wealth and joy. It was not until his late twenties that he encountered suffering, finally witnessing the reality of sickness, old age, and death.&#xA;Committed to discovering a solution to these issues, he adopted the life of a monk, and symbolically cut off his long hair.</description>

      <description>The Islamic principle of Iman, or faith, is composed of six items, which Muslims are expected to believe in order to live a devout life:&#xA;Allah - the existence of one god, who alone created and sustains the universe Angels - messengers of Allah who can communicate with humanity Holy Books - the scriptures, including the Qur&amp;rsquo;an but also elements of the Tanakh (Hebrew Bible) and the message preached by Isa (Jesus) Prophets - the messengers and prophets of Allah who came before Muhammad Day of Judgement - a day on which Allah will assess the character of each person and either send them to heaven or hell Predestination - Allah knows everything that will happen, although the common view is that humans still have free will to make choices References to these six articles of faith are frequently made in Islamic publications - for example, take a look at this information page from the Enfield Islamic Centre&amp;rsquo;s website and see if you can find where the articles are mentioned: http://www.</description>

      <description>Introduction Buddhism is a family of traditions which trace their lineage back to a figure known as Siddartha Gautama, a man who discovered a means of escape from the suffering of existence. It is said that he became &amp;lsquo;awakened&amp;rsquo;, and this is the meaning of his title: Buddha.&#xA;Broadly speaking, Buddhists follow the Four Noble Truths, as expressed by the Buddha:&#xA;Life is unsatisfactory (dukkha) This unsatisfactoriness has a singular cause (samudaya) This cause can be stopped (nirodha) Buddhism is the way to stop it (magga) The precise nature of the underlying cause, the way that unsatisfactoriness manifests, and other key details have been the subject of many Buddhist scriptures, which claim to relate what Gautama, also known by his title of the Awakened One (Buddha), said on these matters.</description>

      <description>Introduction Christians follow the life and teachings of Jesus of Nazareth, a man born around the beginning of the first century in the land which is now Israel. One of the key tenets of Christian belief is that Jesus was not just a man, but he was also the Son of God - the result of a so-called ‘Immaculate Conception’ (his mother was not married at the time that she conceived).</description>

      <guid>https://www.understandingreligion.org.uk/p/hinduism/</guid>
      <description>Introduction There is no such thing as Hinduism. And yet, of course, there is.&#xA;The origins of this religion can be traced back in two ways - the word itself goes back to the time of the Greeks, when it was used to describe anyone (of any religious tradition) who lived east of the Indus river. In that sense, Hindus are a geographic group, not a religious one.&#xA;The word &amp;lsquo;Hindu&amp;rsquo; found additional utility during the time of British colonisation in India, when it was used to group together the country’s diverse religious traditions - this was largely a result of the Western religious framework, which expected to see neatly compartmentalised religions with texts, beliefs, and practices, but which did not really suit the dynamic range of religious identity and expression found outside of Europe.</description>

      <guid>https://www.understandingreligion.org.uk/p/islam/</guid>
      <description>Introduction There is no god but God, and Muhammad is his messenger. This is the core concept of Islam, a monotheistic tradition that emerged in the 7th century in Arabia, and which traces its roots back to the one god of the Hebrews. Muhammad began to receive messages from the one god (Allah) in his later life, and these were memorised, written, and eventually compiled into a single book called the Qur’an (Arabic for the recitation).</description>

      <description>Introduction Smart was a Scottish writer and educator who developed the field of academic religious studies, and helped to distance it from theology. He took the investigation away from which religion was &amp;rsquo;true&amp;rsquo;, and instead looked at the lived experiences of religious adherents.&#xA;Smart identified seven categories that could be used to break up the study of religion into focused areas; he called these the seven dimensions of religion.&#xA;Doctrinal Mythological Ethical Ritual Experiential Institutional Material You can remember them using this mnemonic device:</description>

      <guid>https://www.understandingreligion.org.uk/p/sikhi/</guid>
      <description>Introduction Sikhi is characterised by its founding figures: a series of ten divinely inspired leaders known as Gurus. Unlike Hindu gurus (who tend to be considered holy persons with great wisdom), Sikh Gurus were viewed as conduits of the supreme guru (Waheguru) – i.e. God. Therefore the actions and sayings of the Gurus hold tremendous importance for Sikhs, and during their lifetimes they were instrumental in shaping the tradition.&#xA;Guru and Sikh The foundational relationship in Sikhi is between teacher and pupil, hence the importance of the term Guru (teacher) and Sikh (student).</description>

      <description>The first step in the study of any subject is to define our terms, draw a line around the area we’re interested in, and decide how we’ll investigate.&#xA;Just like any other subject, the method of investigation will influence the type of results we achieve.&#xA;To borrow a metaphor from the world of science: if we use a telescope, we only see things that are large and far away; if we use a microscope, we only see things that are small and close.</description>

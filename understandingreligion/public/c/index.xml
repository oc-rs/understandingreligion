      <description>Hi there, welcome to Introduction to Religious Studies! In this online course we&amp;rsquo;ll be exploring the fundamental basics of what a religion is, how and why people study religion, and also discussing some real world examples of religious thought, tradition, and practice.&#xA;The course is open to absolute beginners; you don&amp;rsquo;t need to know anything about religion or religious studies before we start, but if you already have some experience then you&amp;rsquo;ll definitely find useful material and ideas as we move forward.</description>

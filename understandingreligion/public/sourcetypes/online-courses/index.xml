      <description>Introduction  This free course, A spiritual revolution? Wicca and religious change in the 1960s looks at the &amp;lsquo;crisis&amp;rsquo; of traditional religion in the Sixties in the Western world. It explores the process of religious renewal, looking at the development of Wicca, the prototypical form of modern Paganism. Originally presented as a Goddess religion of great antiquity, which had survived the Roman invasion and Church persecution, Wicca is in fact best seen as a new religion, clearly belonging to an age in which sexual norms, gender roles and traditional power structures were changing.</description>

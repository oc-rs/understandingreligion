      <description>Introduction  Since the 1980s, American Buddhist convert communities have been the site of reoccurring cases of sexual abuse and misconduct. This two-part presentation will reflect on how some contemporary practitioners have responded, in particular identifying &amp;ldquo;generative responses&amp;rdquo; that combine Buddhist and non-Buddhist frameworks to generate new forms of Buddhist thought, community, and practice. Taking a constructive rather than a corrective approach, it will then consider these responses in relationship to the Buddhist sexual ethics found in classical sources, focusing especially on the ideas of consent and intention.</description>

      <description>Introduction A live recording of an online talk and Q+A via zoom on 21st October 2020 for the SOAS Centre of Yoga Studies.
 This presentation by Shaman Hatley builds upon earlier research, where he argued that yoginī temples mark the entry of these goddesses into a wider religious domain, beyond the confines of the earlier esoteric tradition, bridging the ritual worlds of tantra and purāṇa.

      <guid>https://www.understandingreligion.org.uk/s/wicca-religious-change-course/</guid>
      <description>Introduction  This free course, A spiritual revolution? Wicca and religious change in the 1960s looks at the &amp;lsquo;crisis&amp;rsquo; of traditional religion in the Sixties in the Western world. It explores the process of religious renewal, looking at the development of Wicca, the prototypical form of modern Paganism. Originally presented as a Goddess religion of great antiquity, which had survived the Roman invasion and Church persecution, Wicca is in fact best seen as a new religion, clearly belonging to an age in which sexual norms, gender roles and traditional power structures were changing.</description>

      <title>CRPL Seminar 15th October - Buddhist Responses to Sexual Misconduct</title>
      <link>https://www.understandingreligion.org.uk/s/buddhist-responses-sexual-misconduct/</link>

      <guid>https://www.understandingreligion.org.uk/s/buddhist-responses-sexual-misconduct/</guid>
      <description>Introduction  Since the 1980s, American Buddhist convert communities have been the site of reoccurring cases of sexual abuse and misconduct. This two-part presentation will reflect on how some contemporary practitioners have responded, in particular identifying &amp;ldquo;generative responses&amp;rdquo; that combine Buddhist and non-Buddhist frameworks to generate new forms of Buddhist thought, community, and practice. Taking a constructive rather than a corrective approach, it will then consider these responses in relationship to the Buddhist sexual ethics found in classical sources, focusing especially on the ideas of consent and intention.</description>

      <guid>https://www.understandingreligion.org.uk/s/rejected-religion/</guid>
      <description>Introduction  What is meant by &amp;ldquo;rejected&amp;rdquo; in Rejected Religion? Put simply, it&amp;rsquo;s everything that has been considered &amp;lsquo;heretical&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;forbidden&amp;rsquo; by the dominant religions throughout Western history. Think of terms such as &amp;lsquo;the occult&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;the esoteric&amp;rsquo; and all that can be located in that area - magical practices such as witchcraft; alternate worldviews such as Satanism; systems such as astrology and tarot; the use of hallucinogenic substances for &amp;lsquo;spiritual&amp;rsquo; growth; or well-known people such as Aleister Crowley &amp;ndash; this is just a small sample of the larger &amp;lsquo;esoteric&amp;rsquo; category that this platform addresses.</description>

      <description>Introduction  This is a recording of &amp;lsquo;What are worldviews and why should schools teach them?&amp;rsquo; on 21st October 2020.
How RE is taught in schools is a central pillar of any society’s religious literacy, challenging false assumptions and expanding young minds to consider the role of religion and belief in a modern world. In 2018, the Commission on Religious Education launched new proposals for a paradigm shift in the subject, broadening the focus of RE in English schools to a consideration of “Religion and Worldviews”.</description>

      <description>Introduction A live recording of an online talk and Q+A via zoom on 21st October 2020 for the SOAS Centre of Yoga Studies.
 This presentation by Shaman Hatley builds upon earlier research, where he argued that yoginī temples mark the entry of these goddesses into a wider religious domain, beyond the confines of the earlier esoteric tradition, bridging the ritual worlds of tantra and purāṇa.

<p><em>Pages 1-25</em></p>
<h3 id="commentary">Commentary</h3>
<p>James opens his work by acknowledging the novelty of an American lecturing Scottish and European scholars, when it is so often the reverse, and though he is flattered to be placed in the situation of addressing an audience he considers to be filled with his superiors, he hopes the trend continues. Arguably, the entirety of this opening lecture is aimed at establishing a favourable relationship between James and his audience.</p>
<p>He then admits that he is not a theologian, historian of religion, or anthropologist - he is a <strong>psychologist</strong>, and as such he will not focus on religious <em>institutions</em>, but on religious feelings and impulses (in other words, the experiences of the <em>individual</em>).</p>
<p>He also notes that he will be confining himself to &lsquo;those more developed subjective phenomena recorded in literature produced by articulate and fully self-conscious men, in works of piety and autobiography&rsquo; (p. 3). In this he admits a number of limitations - notably the experiences must be &lsquo;more developed&rsquo;, written down, and presumably from male sources. At least these limitations are stated front and centre!</p>
<p>He also points out that he&rsquo;s not interested in early developments, interesting though these might be, he&rsquo;s looking for later &lsquo;more completely evolved and perfect forms&rsquo; (p. 3).</p>
<p>The remainder of the lecture is then dedicated to drawing out the distinction between what he calls <em>existential</em> judgments and <em>spiritual</em> judgments.</p>
<p><strong>Existential judgments</strong> relate to what something is and how it came to be.</p>
<p><strong>Spiritual judgments</strong> relate to something&rsquo;s meaning, value, or purpose.</p>
<p>In his lectures, James notes, he will be using an existential lens, treating the phenomena as though they were &lsquo;mere curious facts of individual history&rsquo; (p. 6). He anticipates that this might upset up his audience (who might well be religious and take the subject matter very seriously), but asks that they bear in mind the distinction and his purpose. He isn&rsquo;t trying to undermine the legitimacy of the experiences, although he notes that attacking something by targeting its origins is a common tactic (for example saying that the visions of Saint Paul are due to his epilispy).</p>
<p>In further clarifying the types of experiences he&rsquo;s interested in, James refers to the religion of &lsquo;ordinary religious believers&rsquo; as &lsquo;second-hand&rsquo; (p. 6), and says that instead he needs to look for the <em>original</em> experiences which were the &lsquo;pattern-setters&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The individuals who have these more powerful experiences are typically unusual &lsquo;geniuses&rsquo;, who might be considered abnormal or eccentric in many ways - he provides a journal entry by George Fox (founder of the Quakers) as an example (Fox is compelled to walk barefoot into a city he has never visited, shouting &lsquo;wo to the bloody city of Lichfield!').</p>
<p>James goes on to further develop the distinction between existential judgments and spiritual judgments, trying to drive home the message that just because a mental state or psychological experience can be tied to a person&rsquo;s physiology (e.g. epilepsy in the case of Saint Paul), that doesn&rsquo;t have any impact on the spiritual value of those experiences - or if it does, then the same criticism could be levelled against <em>every</em> experience - from belief to disbelief, from scientific insights to spiritual revelations. Just because something has a preceding cause that we might discover, that doesn&rsquo;t mean the meaning or value is diminished.</p>
<p>In the closing passages, he notes that the criteria for spiritual judgments have been debated and discussed, but people seem to eventually come back to the same basic tests:</p>
<blockquote>

<p><strong>Lecture I - Religion and Neurology</strong></p>
<p>It is with no small amount of trepidation that I take my place behind this
desk, and face this learned audience. To us Americans, the experience of
receiving instruction from the living voice, as well as from the books, of
European scholars, is very familiar. At my own University of Harvard, not
a winter passes without its harvest, large or small, of lectures from
Scottish, English, French, or German representatives of the science or
literature of their respective countries whom we have either induced to
cross the ocean to address us, or captured on the wing as they were
visiting our land. It seems the natural thing for us to listen whilst the
Europeans talk. The contrary habit, of talking whilst the Europeans
listen, we have not yet acquired; and in him who first makes the adventure
it begets a certain sense of apology being due for so presumptuous an act.
Particularly must this be the case on a soil as sacred to the American
imagination as that of Edinburgh. The glories of the philosophic chair of
this university were deeply impressed on my imagination in boyhood.
Professor Fraser&rsquo;s Essays in Philosophy, then just published, was the
first philosophic book I ever looked into, and I well remember the awe-
struck feeling I received from the account of Sir William Hamilton&rsquo;s
class-room therein contained. Hamilton&rsquo;s own lectures were the first
philosophic writings I ever forced myself to study, and after that I was
immersed in Dugald Stewart and Thomas Brown. Such juvenile emotions of
reverence never get outgrown; and I confess that to find my humble self
promoted from my native wilderness to be actually for the time an official
here, and transmuted into a colleague of these illustrious names, carries
with it a sense of dreamland quite as much as of reality.</p>
<p>But since I have received the honor of this appointment I have felt that
it would never do to decline. The academic career also has its heroic
obligations, so I stand here without further deprecatory words. Let me say
only this, that now that the current, here and at Aberdeen, has begun to
run from west to east, I hope it may continue to do so. As the years go
by, I hope that many of my countrymen may be asked to lecture in the
Scottish universities, changing places with Scotsmen lecturing in the
United States; I hope that our people may become in all these higher
matters even as one people; and that the peculiar philosophic temperament,
as well as the peculiar political temperament, that goes with our English
speech may more and more pervade and influence the world.</p>
<hr>
<p>As regards the manner in which I shall have to administer this
lectureship, I am neither a theologian, nor a scholar learned in the
history of religions, nor an anthropologist. Psychology is the only branch
of learning in which I am particularly versed. To the psychologist the
religious propensities of man must be at least as interesting as any other
of the facts pertaining to his mental constitution. It would seem,
therefore, that, as a psychologist, the natural thing for me would be to
invite you to a descriptive survey of those religious propensities.</p>
<p>If the inquiry be psychological, not religious institutions, but rather
religious feelings and religious impulses must be its subject, and I must
confine myself to those more developed subjective phenomena recorded in
literature produced by articulate and fully self-conscious men, in works
of piety and autobiography. Interesting as the origins and early stages of
a subject always are, yet when one seeks earnestly for its full
significance, one must always look to its more completely evolved and
perfect forms. It follows from this that the documents that will most
concern us will be those of the men who were most accomplished in the
religious life and best able to give an intelligible account of their
ideas and motives. These men, of course, are either comparatively modern
writers, or else such earlier ones as have become religious classics. The
<em>documents humains</em> which we shall find most instructive need not then be
sought for in the haunts of special erudition&ndash;they lie along the beaten
highway; and this circumstance, which flows so naturally from the
character of our problem, suits admirably also your lecturer&rsquo;s lack of
special theological learning. I may take my citations, my sentences and
paragraphs of personal confession, from books that most of you at some
time will have had already in your hands, and yet this will be no
detriment to the value of my conclusions. It is true that some more
adventurous reader and investigator, lecturing here in future, may unearth
from the shelves of libraries documents that will make a more delectable
and curious entertainment to listen to than mine. Yet I doubt whether he
will necessarily, by his control of so much more out-of-the-way material,
get much closer to the essence of the matter in hand.</p>
<p>The question, What are the religious propensities? and the question, What
is their philosophic significance? are two entirely different orders of
question from the logical point of view; and, as a failure to recognize
this fact distinctly may breed confusion, I wish to insist upon the point
a little before we enter into the documents and materials to which I have
referred.</p>
<p>In recent books on logic, distinction is made between two orders of
inquiry concerning anything. First, what is the nature of it? how did it
come about? what is its constitution, origin, and history? And second,
What is its importance, meaning, or significance, now that it is once
here? The answer to the one question is given in an <em>existential judgment</em>
or proposition. The answer to the other is a <em>proposition of value</em>, what
the Germans call a <em>Werthurtheil</em>, or what we may, if we like, denominate
a <em>spiritual judgment</em>. Neither judgment can be deduced immediately from
the other. They proceed from diverse intellectual preoccupations, and the
mind combines them only by making them first separately, and then adding
them together.</p>
<p>In the matter of religions it is particularly easy to distinguish the two
orders of question. Every religious phenomenon has its history and its
derivation from natural antecedents. What is nowadays called the higher
criticism of the Bible is only a study of the Bible from this existential
point of view, neglected too much by the earlier church. Under just what
biographic conditions did the sacred writers bring forth their various
contributions to the holy volume? And what had they exactly in their
several individual minds, when they delivered their utterances? These are
manifestly questions of historical fact, and one does not see how the
answer to them can decide offhand the still further question: of what use
should such a volume, with its manner of coming into existence so defined,
be to us as a guide to life and a revelation? To answer this other
question we must have already in our mind some sort of a general theory as
to what the peculiarities in a thing should be which give it value for
purposes of revelation; and this theory itself would be what I just called
a spiritual judgment. Combining it with our existential judgment, we might
indeed deduce another spiritual judgment as to the Bible&rsquo;s worth. Thus if
our theory of revelation-value were to affirm that any book, to possess
it, must have been composed automatically or not by the free caprice of
the writer, or that it must exhibit no scientific and historic errors and
express no local or personal passions, the Bible would probably fare ill
at our hands. But if, on the other hand, our theory should allow that a
book may well be a revelation in spite of errors and passions and
deliberate human composition, if only it be a true record of the inner
experiences of great-souled persons wrestling with the crises of their
fate, then the verdict would be much more favorable. You see that the
existential facts by themselves are insufficient for determining the
value; and the best adepts of the higher criticism accordingly never
confound the existential with the spiritual problem. With the same
conclusions of fact before them, some take one view, and some another, of
the Bible&rsquo;s value as a revelation, according as their spiritual judgment
as to the foundation of values differs.</p>
<hr>
<p>I make these general remarks about the two sorts of judgment, because
there are many religious persons&ndash;some of you now present, possibly, are
among them&ndash;who do not yet make a working use of the distinction, and who
may therefore feel at first a little startled at the purely existential
point of view from which in the following lectures the phenomena of
religious experience must be considered. When I handle them biologically
and psychologically as if they were mere curious facts of individual
history, some of you may think it a degradation of so sublime a subject,
and may even suspect me, until my purpose gets more fully expressed, of
deliberately seeking to discredit the religious side of life.</p>
<p>Such a result is of course absolutely alien to my intention; and since
such a prejudice on your part would seriously obstruct the due effect of
much of what I have to relate, I will devote a few more words to the
point.</p>
<p>There can be no doubt that as a matter of fact a religious life,
exclusively pursued, does tend to make the person exceptional and
eccentric. I speak not now of your ordinary religious believer, who
follows the conventional observances of his country, whether it be
Buddhist, Christian, or Mohammedan. His religion has been made for him by
others, communicated to him by tradition, determined to fixed forms by
imitation, and retained by habit. It would profit us little to study this
second-hand religious life. We must make search rather for the original
experiences which were the pattern-setters to all this mass of suggested
feeling and imitated conduct. These experiences we can only find in
individuals for whom religion exists not as a dull habit, but as an acute
fever rather. But such individuals are &ldquo;geniuses&rdquo; in the religious line;
and like many other geniuses who have brought forth fruits effective
enough for commemoration in the pages of biography, such religious
geniuses have often shown symptoms of nervous instability. Even more
perhaps than other kinds of genius, religious leaders have been subject to
abnormal psychical visitations. Invariably they have been creatures of
exalted emotional sensibility. Often they have led a discordant inner
life, and had melancholy during a part of their career. They have known no
measure, been liable to obsessions and fixed ideas; and frequently they
have fallen into trances, heard voices, seen visions, and presented all
sorts of peculiarities which are ordinarily classed as pathological.
Often, moreover, these pathological features in their career have helped
to give them their religious authority and influence.</p>
<p>If you ask for a concrete example, there can be no better one than is
furnished by the person of George Fox. The Quaker religion which he
founded is something which it is impossible to overpraise. In a day of
shams, it was a religion of veracity rooted in spiritual inwardness, and a
return to something more like the original gospel truth than men had ever
known in England. So far as our Christian sects to-day are evolving into
liberality, they are simply reverting in essence to the position which Fox
and the early Quakers so long ago assumed. No one can pretend for a moment
that in point of spiritual sagacity and capacity, Fox&rsquo;s mind was unsound.
Every one who confronted him personally, from Oliver Cromwell down to
county magistrates and jailers, seems to have acknowledged his superior
power. Yet from the point of view of his nervous constitution, Fox was a
psychopath or <em>détraqué</em> of the deepest dye. His Journal abounds in
entries of this sort:&ndash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;As I was walking with several friends, I lifted up my head, and
saw three steeple-house spires, and they struck at my life. I
asked them what place that was? They said, Lichfield. Immediately
the word of the Lord came to me, that I must go thither. Being
come to the house we were going to, I wished the friends to walk
into the house, saying nothing to them of whither I was to go. As
soon as they were gone I stept away, and went by my eye over hedge
and ditch till I came within a mile of Lichfield; where, in a
great field, shepherds were keeping their sheep. Then was I
commanded by the Lord to pull off my shoes. I stood still, for it
was winter: but the word of the Lord was like a fire in me. So I
put off my shoes, and left them with the shepherds; and the poor
shepherds trembled, and were astonished. Then I walked on about a
mile, and as soon as I was got within the city, the word of the
Lord came to me again, saying: Cry, &lsquo;Wo to the bloody city of
Lichfield!&rsquo; So I went up and down the streets, crying with a loud
voice, Wo to the bloody city of Lichfield! It being market day, I
went into the market-place, and to and fro in the several parts of
it, and made stands, crying as before, Wo to the bloody city of
Lichfield! And no one laid hands on me. As I went thus crying
through the streets, there seemed to me to be a channel of blood
running down the streets, and the market-place appeared like a
pool of blood. When I had declared what was upon me, and felt
myself clear, I went out of the town in peace; and returning to
the shepherds gave them some money, and took my shoes of them
again. But the fire of the Lord was so on my feet, and all over
me, that I did not matter to put on my shoes again, and was at a
stand whether I should or no, till I felt freedom from the Lord so
to do: then, after I had washed my feet, I put on my shoes again.
After this a deep consideration came upon me, for what reason I
should be sent to cry against that city, and call it The bloody
city! For though the parliament had the minister one while, and
the king another, and much blood had been shed in the town during
the wars between them, yet there was no more than had befallen
many other places. But afterwards I came to understand, that in
the Emperor Diocletian&rsquo;s time a thousand Christians were martyr&rsquo;d
in Lichfield. So I was to go, without my shoes, through the
channel of their blood, and into the pool of their blood in the
market-place, that I might raise up the memorial of the blood of
those martyrs, which had been shed above a thousand years before,
and lay cold in their streets. So the sense of this blood was upon
me, and I obeyed the word of the Lord.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bent as we are on studying religion&rsquo;s existential conditions, we cannot
possibly ignore these pathological aspects of the subject. We must
describe and name them just as if they occurred in non-religious men. It
is true that we instinctively recoil from seeing an object to which our
emotions and affections are committed handled by the intellect as any
other object is handled. The first thing the intellect does with an object
is to class it along with something else. But any object that is
infinitely important to us and awakens our devotion feels to us also as if
it must be <em>sui generis</em> and unique. Probably a crab would be filled with
a sense of personal outrage if it could hear us class it without ado or
apology as a crustacean, and thus dispose of it. &ldquo;I am no such thing,&rdquo; it
would say; &ldquo;I am MYSELF, MYSELF alone.&rdquo;</p>
<hr>
<p>The next thing the intellect does is to lay bare the causes in which the
thing originates. Spinoza says: &ldquo;I will analyze the actions and appetites
of men as if it were a question of lines, of planes, and of solids.&rdquo; And
elsewhere he remarks that he will consider our passions and their
properties with the same eye with which he looks on all other natural
things, since the consequences of our affections flow from their nature
with the same necessity as it results from the nature of a triangle that
its three angles should be equal to two right angles. Similarly M. Taine,
in the introduction to his history of English literature, has written:
&ldquo;Whether facts be moral or physical, it makes no matter. They always have
their causes. There are causes for ambition, courage, veracity, just as
there are for digestion, muscular movement, animal heat. Vice and virtue
are products like vitriol and sugar.&rdquo; When we read such proclamations of
the intellect bent on showing the existential conditions of absolutely
everything, we feel&ndash;quite apart from our legitimate impatience at the
somewhat ridiculous swagger of the program, in view of what the authors
are actually able to perform&ndash;menaced and negated in the springs of our
innermost life. Such cold-blooded assimilations threaten, we think, to
undo our soul&rsquo;s vital secrets, as if the same breath which should succeed
in explaining their origin would simultaneously explain away their
significance, and make them appear of no more preciousness, either, than
the useful groceries of which M. Taine speaks.</p>
<p>Perhaps the commonest expression of this assumption that spiritual value
is undone if lowly origin be asserted is seen in those comments which
unsentimental people so often pass on their more sentimental
acquaintances. Alfred believes in immortality so strongly because his
temperament is so emotional. Fanny&rsquo;s extraordinary conscientiousness is
merely a matter of over-instigated nerves. William&rsquo;s melancholy about the
universe is due to bad digestion&ndash;probably his liver is torpid. Eliza&rsquo;s
delight in her church is a symptom of her hysterical constitution. Peter
would be less troubled about his soul if he would take more exercise in
the open air, etc. A more fully developed example of the same kind of
reasoning is the fashion, quite common nowadays among certain writers, of
criticising the religious emotions by showing a connection between them
and the sexual life. Conversion is a crisis of puberty and adolescence.
The macerations of saints, and the devotion of missionaries, are only
instances of the parental instinct of self-sacrifice gone astray. For the
hysterical nun, starving for natural life, Christ is but an imaginary
substitute for a more earthly object of affection. And the like.[^1]</p>
<p>We are surely all familiar in a general way with this method of
discrediting states of mind for which we have an antipathy. We all use it
to some degree in criticising persons whose states of mind we regard as
overstrained. But when other people criticise our own more exalted soul-
flights by calling them &ldquo;nothing but&rdquo; expressions of our organic
disposition, we feel outraged and hurt, for we know that, whatever be our
organism&rsquo;s peculiarities, our mental states have their substantive value
as revelations of the living truth; and we wish that all this medical
materialism could be made to hold its tongue.</p>
<p>Medical materialism seems indeed a good appellation for the too simple-
minded system of thought which we are considering. Medical materialism
finishes up Saint Paul by calling his vision on the road to Damascus a
discharging lesion of the occipital cortex, he being an epileptic. It
snuffs out Saint Teresa as an hysteric, Saint Francis of Assisi as an
hereditary degenerate. George Fox&rsquo;s discontent with the shams of his age,
and his pining for spiritual veracity, it treats as a symptom of a
disordered colon. Carlyle&rsquo;s organ-tones of misery it accounts for by a
gastro-duodenal catarrh. All such mental over-tensions, it says, are, when
you come to the bottom of the matter, mere affairs of diathesis (auto-
intoxications most probably), due to the perverted action of various
glands which physiology will yet discover.</p>
<p>And medical materialism then thinks that the spiritual authority of all
such personages is successfully undermined.(2)</p>
<p>Let us ourselves look at the matter in the largest possible way. Modern
psychology, finding definite psycho-physical connections to hold good,
assumes as a convenient hypothesis that the dependence of mental states
upon bodily conditions must be thorough-going and complete. If we adopt
the assumption, then of course what medical materialism insists on must be
true in a general way, if not in every detail: Saint Paul certainly had
once an epileptoid, if not an epileptic seizure; George Fox was an
hereditary degenerate; Carlyle was undoubtedly auto-intoxicated by some
organ or other, no matter which,&ndash;and the rest. But now, I ask you, how can
such an existential account of facts of mental history decide in one way
or another upon their spiritual significance? According to the general
postulate of psychology just referred to, there is not a single one of our
states of mind, high or low, healthy or morbid, that has not some organic
process as its condition. Scientific theories are organically conditioned
just as much as religious emotions are; and if we only knew the facts
intimately enough, we should doubtless see &ldquo;the liver&rdquo; determining the
dicta of the sturdy atheist as decisively as it does those of the
Methodist under conviction anxious about his soul. When it alters in one
way the blood that percolates it, we get the methodist, when in another
way, we get the atheist form of mind. So of all our raptures and our
drynesses, our longings and pantings, our questions and beliefs. They are
equally organically founded, be they of religious or of non-religious
content.</p>
<p>To plead the organic causation of a religious state of mind, then, in
refutation of its claim to possess superior spiritual value, is quite
illogical and arbitrary, unless one have already worked out in advance
some psycho-physical theory connecting spiritual values in general with
determinate sorts of physiological change. Otherwise none of our thoughts
and feelings, not even our scientific doctrines, not even our
<em>dis</em>-beliefs, could retain any value as revelations of the truth, for
every one of them without exception flows from the state of their
possessor&rsquo;s body at the time.</p>
<p>It is needless to say that medical materialism draws in point of fact no
such sweeping skeptical conclusion. It is sure, just as every simple man
is sure, that some states of mind are inwardly superior to others, and
reveal to us more truth, and in this it simply makes use of an ordinary
spiritual judgment. It has no physiological theory of the production of
these its favorite states, by which it may accredit them; and its attempt
to discredit the states which it dislikes, by vaguely associating them
with nerves and liver, and connecting them with names connoting bodily
affliction, is altogether illogical and inconsistent.</p>
<p>Let us play fair in this whole matter, and be quite candid with ourselves
and with the facts. When we think certain states of mind superior to
others, is it ever because of what we know concerning their organic
antecedents? No! it is always for two entirely different reasons. It is
either because we take an immediate delight in them; or else it is because
we believe them to bring us good consequential fruits for life. When we
speak disparagingly of &ldquo;feverish fancies,&rdquo; surely the fever-process as
such is not the ground of our disesteem&ndash;for aught we know to the contrary,
103° or 104° Fahrenheit might be a much more favorable temperature for
truths to germinate and sprout in, than the more ordinary blood-heat of 97
or 98 degrees. It is either the disagreeableness itself of the fancies, or
their inability to bear the criticisms of the convalescent hour. When we
praise the thoughts which health brings, health&rsquo;s peculiar chemical
metabolisms have nothing to do with determining our judgment. We know in
fact almost nothing about these metabolisms. It is the character of inner
happiness in the thoughts which stamps them as good, or else their
consistency with our other opinions and their serviceability for our
needs, which make them pass for true in our esteem.</p>
<p>Now the more intrinsic and the more remote of these criteria do not always
hang together. Inner happiness and serviceability do not always agree.
What immediately feels most &ldquo;good&rdquo; is not always most &ldquo;true,&rdquo; when
measured by the verdict of the rest of experience. The difference between
Philip drunk and Philip sober is the classic instance in corroboration. If
merely &ldquo;feeling good&rdquo; could decide, drunkenness would be the supremely
valid human experience. But its revelations, however acutely satisfying at
the moment, are inserted into an environment which refuses to bear them
out for any length of time. The consequence of this discrepancy of the two
criteria is the uncertainty which still prevails over so many of our
spiritual judgments. There are moments of sentimental and mystical
experience&ndash;we shall hereafter hear much of them&ndash;that carry an enormous
sense of inner authority and illumination with them when they come. But
they come seldom, and they do not come to every one; and the rest of life
makes either no connection with them, or tends to contradict them more
than it confirms them. Some persons follow more the voice of the moment in
these cases, some prefer to be guided by the average results. Hence the
sad discordancy of so many of the spiritual judgments of human beings; a
discordancy which will be brought home to us acutely enough before these
lectures end.</p>
<hr>
<p>It is, however, a discordancy that can never be resolved by any merely
medical test. A good example of the impossibility of holding strictly to
the medical tests is seen in the theory of the pathological causation of
genius promulgated by recent authors. &ldquo;Genius,&rdquo; said Dr. Moreau, &ldquo;is but
one of the many branches of the neuropathic tree.&rdquo; &ldquo;Genius,&rdquo; says Dr.
Lombroso, &ldquo;is a symptom of hereditary degeneration of the epileptoid
variety, and is allied to moral insanity.&rdquo; &ldquo;Whenever a man&rsquo;s life,&rdquo; writes
Mr. Nisbet, &ldquo;is at once sufficiently illustrious and recorded with
sufficient fullness to be a subject of profitable study, he inevitably
falls into the morbid category&hellip;. And it is worthy of remark that, as a
rule, the greater the genius, the greater the unsoundness.&quot;(3)</p>
<p>Now do these authors, after having succeeded in establishing to their own
satisfaction that the works of genius are fruits of disease, consistently
proceed thereupon to impugn the <em>value</em> of the fruits? Do they deduce a
new spiritual judgment from their new doctrine of existential conditions?
Do they frankly forbid us to admire the productions of genius from now
onwards? and say outright that no neuropath can ever be a revealer of new
truth?</p>
<p>No! their immediate spiritual instincts are too strong for them here, and
hold their own against inferences which, in mere love of logical
consistency, medical materialism ought to be only too glad to draw. One
disciple of the school, indeed, has striven to impugn the value of works
of genius in a wholesale way (such works of contemporary art, namely, as
he himself is unable to enjoy, and they are many) by using medical
arguments.(4) But for the most part the masterpieces are left
unchallenged; and the medical line of attack either confines itself to
such secular productions as every one admits to be intrinsically
eccentric, or else addresses itself exclusively to religious
manifestations. And then it is because the religious manifestations have
been already condemned because the critic dislikes them on internal or
spiritual grounds.</p>
<p>In the natural sciences and industrial arts it never occurs to any one to
try to refute opinions by showing up their author&rsquo;s neurotic constitution.
Opinions here are invariably tested by logic and by experiment, no matter
what may be their author&rsquo;s neurological type. It should be no otherwise
with religious opinions. Their value can only be ascertained by spiritual
judgments directly passed upon them, judgments based on our own immediate
feeling primarily; and secondarily on what we can ascertain of their
experiential relations to our moral needs and to the rest of what we hold
as true.</p>
<p><em>Immediate luminousness</em>, in short, <em>philosophical reasonableness</em>, and
<em>moral helpfulness</em> are the only available criteria. Saint Teresa might
have had the nervous system of the placidest cow, and it would not now
save her theology, if the trial of the theology by these other tests
should show it to be contemptible. And conversely if her theology can
stand these other tests, it will make no difference how hysterical or
nervously off her balance Saint Teresa may have been when she was with us
here below.</p>
<hr>
<p>You see that at bottom we are thrown back upon the general principles by
which the empirical philosophy has always contended that we must be guided
in our search for truth. Dogmatic philosophies have sought for tests for
truth which might dispense us from appealing to the future. Some direct
mark, by noting which we can be protected immediately and absolutely, now
and forever, against all mistake&ndash;such has been the darling dream of
philosophic dogmatists. It is clear that the <em>origin</em> of the truth would
be an admirable criterion of this sort, if only the various origins could
be discriminated from one another from this point of view, and the history
of dogmatic opinion shows that origin has always been a favorite test.
Origin in immediate intuition; origin in pontifical authority; origin in
supernatural revelation, as by vision, hearing, or unaccountable
impression; origin in direct possession by a higher spirit, expressing
itself in prophecy and warning; origin in automatic utterance
generally,&ndash;these origins have been stock warrants for the truth of one
opinion after another which we find represented in religious history. The
medical materialists are therefore only so many belated dogmatists, neatly
turning the tables on their predecessors by using the criterion of origin
in a destructive instead of an accreditive way.</p>
<p>They are effective with their talk of pathological origin only so long as
supernatural origin is pleaded by the other side, and nothing but the
argument from origin is under discussion. But the argument from origin has
seldom been used alone, for it is too obviously insufficient. Dr. Maudsley
is perhaps the cleverest of the rebutters of supernatural religion on
grounds of origin. Yet he finds himself forced to write:&ndash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;What right have we to believe Nature under any obligation to do her work
by means of complete minds only? She may find an incomplete mind a more
suitable instrument for a particular purpose. It is the work that is done,
and the quality in the worker by which it was done, that is alone of
moment; and it may be no great matter from a cosmical standpoint, if in
other qualities of character he was singularly defective&ndash;if indeed he were
hypocrite, adulterer, eccentric, or lunatic&hellip;. Home we come again, then,
to the old and last resort of certitude,&ndash;namely the common assent of
mankind, or of the competent by instruction and training among
mankind.&quot;(5)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, not its origin, but <em>the way in which it works on the
whole</em>, is Dr. Maudsley&rsquo;s final test of a belief. This is our own
empiricist criterion; and this criterion the stoutest insisters on
supernatural origin have also been forced to use in the end. Among the
visions and messages some have always been too patently silly, among the
trances and convulsive seizures some have been too fruitless for conduct
and character, to pass themselves off as significant, still less as
divine. In the history of Christian mysticism the problem how to
discriminate between such messages and experiences as were really divine
miracles, and such others as the demon in his malice was able to
counterfeit, thus making the religious person twofold more the child of
hell he was before, has always been a difficult one to solve, needing all
the sagacity and experience of the best directors of conscience. In the
end it had to come to our empiricist criterion: By their fruits ye shall
know them, not by their roots, Jonathan Edwards&rsquo;s Treatise on Religious
Affections is an elaborate working out of this thesis. The <em>roots</em> of a
man&rsquo;s virtue are inaccessible to us. No appearances whatever are
infallible proofs of grace. Our practice is the only sure evidence, even
to ourselves, that we are genuinely Christians.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;In forming a judgment of ourselves now,&rdquo; Edwards writes, &ldquo;we
should certainly adopt that evidence which our supreme Judge will
chiefly make use of when we come to stand before him at the last
day&hellip;. There is not one grace of the Spirit of God, of the
existence of which, in any professor of religion, Christian
practice is not the most decisive evidence&hellip;. The degree in which
our experience is productive of practice shows the degree in which
our experience is spiritual and divine.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Catholic writers are equally emphatic. The good dispositions which a
vision, or voice, or other apparent heavenly favor leave behind them are
the only marks by which we may be sure they are not possible deceptions of
the tempter. Says Saint Teresa:&ndash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Like imperfect sleep which, instead of giving more strength to
the head, doth but leave it the more exhausted, the result of mere
operations of the imagination is but to weaken the soul. Instead
of nourishment and energy she reaps only lassitude and disgust:
whereas a genuine heavenly vision yields to her a harvest of
ineffable spiritual riches, and an admirable renewal of bodily
strength. I alleged these reasons to those who so often accused my
visions of being the work of the enemy of mankind and the sport of
my imagination&hellip;. I showed them the jewels which the divine hand
had left with me:&ndash;they were my actual dispositions. All those who
knew me saw that I was changed; my confessor bore witness to the
fact; this improvement, palpable in all respects, far from being
hidden, was brilliantly evident to all men. As for myself, it was
impossible to believe that if the demon were its author, he could
have used, in order to lose me and lead me to hell, an expedient
so contrary to his own interests as that of uprooting my vices,
and filling me with masculine courage and other virtues instead,
for I saw clearly that a single one of these visions was enough to
enrich me with all that wealth.&quot;(6)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I fear I may have made a longer excursus than was necessary, and that
fewer words would have dispelled the uneasiness which may have arisen
among some of you as I announced my pathological programme. At any rate
you must all be ready now to judge the religious life by its results
exclusively, and I shall assume that the bugaboo of morbid origin will
scandalize your piety no more.</p>
<p>Still, you may ask me, if its results are to be the ground of our final
spiritual estimate of a religious phenomenon, why threaten us at all with
so much existential study of its conditions? Why not simply leave
pathological questions out?</p>
<p>To this I reply in two ways: First, I say, irrepressible curiosity
imperiously leads one on; and I say, secondly, that it always leads to a
better understanding of a thing&rsquo;s significance to consider its
exaggerations and perversions, its equivalents and substitutes and nearest
relatives elsewhere. Not that we may thereby swamp the thing in the
wholesale condemnation which we pass on its inferior congeners, but rather
that we may by contrast ascertain the more precisely in what its merits
consist, by learning at the same time to what particular dangers of
corruption it may also be exposed.</p>
<p>Insane conditions have this advantage, that they isolate special factors
of the mental life, and enable us to inspect them unmasked by their more
usual surroundings. They play the part in mental anatomy which the scalpel
and the microscope play in the anatomy of the body. To understand a thing
rightly we need to see it both out of its environment and in it, and to
have acquaintance with the whole range of its variations. The study of
hallucinations has in this way been for psychologists the key to their
comprehension of normal sensation, that of illusions has been the key to
the right comprehension of perception. Morbid impulses and imperative
conceptions, &ldquo;fixed ideas,&rdquo; so called, have thrown a flood of light on the
psychology of the normal will; and obsessions and delusions have performed
the same service for that of the normal faculty of belief.</p>
<p>Similarly, the nature of genius has been illuminated by the attempts, of
which I already made mention, to class it with psychopathical phenomena.
Borderland insanity, crankiness, insane temperament, loss of mental
balance, psychopathic degeneration (to use a few of the many synonyms by
which it has been called), has certain peculiarities and liabilities
which, when combined with a superior quality of intellect in an
individual, make it more probable that he will make his mark and affect
his age, than if his temperament were less neurotic. There is of course no
special affinity between crankiness as such and superior intellect,(7) for
most psychopaths have feeble intellects, and superior intellects more
commonly have normal nervous systems. But the psychopathic temperament,
whatever be the intellect with which it finds itself paired, often brings
with it ardor and excitability of character. The cranky person has
extraordinary emotional susceptibility. He is liable to fixed ideas and
obsessions. His conceptions tend to pass immediately into belief and
action; and when he gets a new idea, he has no rest till he proclaims it,
or in some way &ldquo;works it off.&rdquo; &ldquo;What shall I think of it?&rdquo; a common person
says to himself about a vexed question; but in a &ldquo;cranky&rdquo; mind &ldquo;What must
I do about it?&rdquo; is the form the question tends to take. In the
autobiography of that high-souled woman, Mrs. Annie Besant, I read the
following passage: &ldquo;Plenty of people wish well to any good cause, but very
few care to exert themselves to help it, and still fewer will risk
anything in its support. &lsquo;Some one ought to do it, but why should I?&rsquo; is
the ever reëchoed phrase of weak-kneed amiability. &lsquo;Some one ought to do
it, so why not I?&rsquo; is the cry of some earnest servant of man, eagerly
forward springing to face some perilous duty. Between these two sentences
lie whole centuries of moral evolution.&rdquo; True enough! and between these
two sentences lie also the different destinies of the ordinary sluggard
and the psychopathic man. Thus, when a superior intellect and a
psychopathic temperament coalesce&ndash;as in the endless permutations and
combinations of human faculty, they are bound to coalesce often enough&ndash;in
the same individual, we have the best possible condition for the kind of
effective genius that gets into the biographical dictionaries. Such men do
not remain mere critics and understanders with their intellect. Their
ideas possess them, they inflict them, for better or worse, upon their
companions or their age. It is they who get counted when Messrs Lombroso,
Nisbet, and others invoke statistics to defend their paradox.</p>
<p>To pass now to religious phenomena, take the melancholy which, as we shall
see, constitutes an essential moment in every complete religious
evolution. Take the happiness which achieved religious belief confers.
Take the trance-like states of insight into truth which all religious
mystics report.(8) These are each and all of them special cases of kinds
of human experience of much wider scope. Religious melancholy, whatever
peculiarities it may have <em>quâ</em> religious, is at any rate melancholy.
Religious happiness is happiness. Religious trance is trance. And the
moment we renounce the absurd notion that a thing is exploded away as soon
as it is classed with others, or its origin is shown; the moment we agree
to stand by experimental results and inner quality, in judging of
values,&ndash;who does not see that we are likely to ascertain the distinctive
significance of religious melancholy and happiness, or of religious
trances, far better by comparing them as conscientiously as we can with
other varieties of melancholy, happiness, and trance, than by refusing to
consider their place in any more general series, and treating them as if
they were outside of nature&rsquo;s order altogether?</p>
<p>I hope that the course of these lectures will confirm us in this
supposition. As regards the psychopathic origin of so many religious
phenomena, that would not be in the least surprising or disconcerting,
even were such phenomena certified from on high to be the most precious of
human experiences. No one organism can possibly yield to its owner the
whole body of truth. Few of us are not in some way infirm, or even
diseased; and our very infirmities help us unexpectedly. In the
psychopathic temperament we have the emotionality which is the <em>sine quâ
non</em> of moral perception; we have the intensity and tendency to emphasis
which are the essence of practical moral vigor; and we have the love of
metaphysics and mysticism which carry one&rsquo;s interests beyond the surface
of the sensible world. What, then, is more natural than that this
temperament should introduce one to regions of religious truth, to corners
of the universe, which your robust Philistine type of nervous system,
forever offering its biceps to be felt, thumping its breast, and thanking
Heaven that it hasn&rsquo;t a single morbid fibre in its composition, would be
sure to hide forever from its self-satisfied possessors?</p>
<p>If there were such a thing as inspiration from a higher realm, it might
well be that the neurotic temperament would furnish the chief condition of
the requisite receptivity. And having said thus much, I think that I may
let the matter of religion and neuroticism drop.</p>
<hr>
<p>The mass of collateral phenomena, morbid or healthy, with which the
various religious phenomena must be compared in order to understand them
better, forms what in the slang of pedagogics is termed &ldquo;the apperceiving
mass&rdquo; by which we comprehend them. The only novelty that I can imagine
this course of lectures to possess lies in the breadth of the apperceiving
mass. I may succeed in discussing religious experiences in a wider context
than has been usual in university courses.</p>

<p>There is no one, single definition of religion - and so the definition being used here to isolate &lsquo;religious&rsquo; experiences is by its very nature provisional. Yet without such a definition, it would be difficult to proceed, so its limitations and precise definition <em>in this context</em> will need to be borne in mind throughout.</p>

                            Alternative perspectives, due to their absence in mainstream texts and dismissal by historical scholars, are sometimes difficult to hear over the sound of traditional narratives – but this is increasingly changing for the better.

                            Religious systems often include beliefs about the world (both seen and unseen), which describe (or dictate) how the world operates. Subscribing to a set of beliefs (orthodoxy) is not always essential for belonging to a religion.

                            Texts (of all kinds) are controlled and mediated by people, and therefore restrictions can sometimes be made about which texts are preserved and shared, and which are ignored or destroyed. This can lead to an erasure of certain material from a religious tradition, or from the public understanding of that tradition, particularly if the material disagrees with the perspective of those in positions of power.

                            Smart was a Scottish writer and educator who developed the field of academic religious studies, and helped to distance it from theology. He took the investigation away from which religion was &#39;true&#39;, and instead looked at the lived experiences of religious adherents.

                            Pilgrimage is a practice of journeying to a significant location, but the location, method of travel, and meaning attached can vary widely. There is often a close relationship, or even overlap, with tourism.

                            Religious practices are those behaviours and actions that have religious meaning for those who perform them; there are many different types and examples of such practices, including pilgrimage to holy sites (such as the tomb of Imam Husayn for Shi&#39;ite Muslims), prayer, and song – to name a few.

                            Within Islam, there are three aspects which are generally agreed upon - these are islam (submission), iman (faith), and ihsan (perfection). In this article, we&#39;re going to focus on iman and see how it is understood in relation to Islam as a religious tradition, but it&#39;s clear from this threefold division that faith by itself isn&#39;t the whole story.

                            To claim that a location, structure, or geographical feature is sacred is to assert that it is set apart and regarded with special reverence, yet there are many ways to understand this sacrality, where it comes from, and how it is expressed by different groups of people.

                            The modern study of religion, beginning in the 19th Century, has been traditionally driven by male European scholars, who have carried their own cultural biases and assumptions - some unconscious, others less so.

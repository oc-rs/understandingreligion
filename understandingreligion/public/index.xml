      <description>The first step in the study of any subject is to define our terms, draw a line around the area we’re interested in, and decide how we’ll investigate.
Just like any other subject, the method of investigation will influence the type of results we achieve.
To borrow a metaphor from the world of science: if we use a telescope, we only see things that are large and far away; if we use a microscope, we only see things that are small and close.</description>

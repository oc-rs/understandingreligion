      <description>Animism is a category of religious systems in which human activity is understood within a broader context of persons and their relationships; these persons may include visible beings such as humans, animals, plants, and rocks, and non-visible beings such as spirits or ancestors.
New animism is differentiated from &amp;lsquo;old&amp;rsquo; animism by its focus on relational ontologies - ways of being in the world which hinge on relationships, thus taking a more nuanced approach to the subject than historical efforts, which typically centered on the belief in souls which inhabit material bodies and natural phenomena.</description>

      <description>Believing in the unseen One of the most prominent and well-known aspects of religion in the Western world is faith. This term often comes with a variety of associated meanings and implications, but at its root we can say that faith involves belief in a set of doctrines or creeds which provide meaning and direction, often in the absence of empirical evidence.
Since the relationship between religious belief and scientific empiricism has often been contentious, it&amp;rsquo;s worthwhile looking a little more closely at how people believe in things, and what this means.</description>

      <description>The Islamic principle of Iman, or faith, is composed of six items, which Muslims are expected to believe in order to live a devout life:
 Allah - the existence of one god, who alone created and sustains the universe Angels - messengers of Allah who can communicate with humanity Holy Books - the scriptures, including the Qur&amp;rsquo;an but also elements of the Tanakh (Hebrew Bible) and the message preached by Isa (Jesus) Prophets - the messengers and prophets of Allah who came before Muhammad Day of Judgement - a day on which Allah will assess the character of each person and either send them to heaven or hell Predestination - Allah knows everything that will happen, although the common view is that humans still have free will to make choices  References to these six articles of faith are frequently made in Islamic publications - for example, take a look at this information page from the Enfield Islamic Centre&amp;rsquo;s website and see if you can find where the articles are mentioned: http://www.</description>

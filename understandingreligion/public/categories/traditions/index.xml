      <description>Introduction The Jain religious tradition focuses on liberation from the suffering of rebirth, and in this sense has common ground with its near geographic neighbours - Hinduism and Buddhism. For Jains, karma is an accretion of negative energy, collected over many lives - like pollen clinging to the legs of a bee. The goal of human life is to shed this karma, and once free from it, achieve supreme liberation - moksha.</description>

      <description>Introduction The International Church of Cannabis is a religious group based in Denver, Colorado, USA, which uses cannabis during its ceremonies in order to help members have a better understanding of themselves.
The church is unaffiliated with any other religious traditions, but its members are not restricted in any way - the church is viewed as a supplement to, rather than a replacement for, a person’s religious identity.
 &amp;hellip;there is no need to convert to Elevationism.</description>

      <guid>https://www.understandingreligion.org.uk/p/yazidism/</guid>
      <description>Introduction  Yazidism or Sharfadin (Kurdish: شه‌رفه‌دین, Êzdiyatî, Êzdîtî, Şerfedîn,‎) is a monotheistic ethnic religion that has roots in a western Iranic pre-Zoroastrian religion directly derived from the Indo-Iranian tradition, although other, less common and more outdated narratives link the religion to Zoroastrianism and even Ancient Mesopotamian Religions. Yezidism is followed by the mainly Kurmanji-speaking Yazidis and is based on belief in one God who created the world and entrusted it into the care of seven Holy Beings, known as Angels.</description>

      <title>Caodaism</title>
      <link>https://www.understandingreligion.org.uk/p/caodaism/</link>

      <guid>https://www.understandingreligion.org.uk/p/caodaism/</guid>
      <description>Introduction At less than a century old, the Cao Dai religion (also known as Caodaism) is arguably a New Religious Movement. It emerged in Vietnam during the 1920s and based its structure on that of the Roman Catholic Church, but drew its principles and practices from Buddhism, Daoism, Christianity, and Confucianism (religious systems all alive in Vietnam at that time).
The tradition is traced back to Ngô Văn Chiêu, a Vietnamese official in the French colonial administration, who was particularly interested in religion and spiritualism (contact with the dead).</description>

      <guid>https://www.understandingreligion.org.uk/p/mahayana-buddhism/</guid>
      <description>Introduction Mahayana is a form of Buddhism that includes many divergent traditions spread over a geographically and culturally diverse area, but can be summarised as a religion where compassion for others is the principal virtue. For Mahayanists, the aspirational figure is the bodhisattva: one who delays their own salvation in order to help others achieve liberation first.</description>

      <guid>https://www.understandingreligion.org.uk/p/theravada-buddhism/</guid>
      <description>Introduction Theravada is a form of Buddhism that claims to represent an historically accurate version of Buddhism, which venerates the Buddha but does not deify him, follows the teachings of the old scriptures (the Pali Canon), and values the aspirational figure of the arhat: the liberated individual who finds freedom by strength of will.</description>

      <guid>https://www.understandingreligion.org.uk/p/buddhism/</guid>
      <description>Introduction Buddhism is a family of traditions which trace their lineage back to a figure known as Siddartha Gautama, a man who discovered a means of escape from the suffering of existence. It is said that he became &amp;lsquo;awakened&amp;rsquo;, and this is the meaning of his title: Buddha.
Broadly speaking, Buddhists follow the Four Noble Truths, as expressed by the Buddha:
 Life is unsatisfactory (dukkha) This unsatisfactoriness has a singular cause (samudaya) This cause can be stopped (nirodha) Buddhism is the way to stop it (magga)  The precise nature of the underlying cause, the way that unsatisfactoriness manifests, and other key details have been the subject of many Buddhist scriptures, which claim to relate what Gautama, also known by his title of the Awakened One (Buddha), said on these matters.</description>

      <guid>https://www.understandingreligion.org.uk/p/christianity/</guid>
      <description>Introduction Christians follow the life and teachings of Jesus of Nazareth, a man born around the beginning of the first century in the land which is now Israel. One of the key tenets of Christian belief is that Jesus was not just a man, but he was also the Son of God - the result of a so-called ‘Immaculate Conception’ (his mother was not married at the time that she conceived).</description>

      <title>Hinduism</title>
      <link>https://www.understandingreligion.org.uk/p/hinduism/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 14 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.understandingreligion.org.uk/p/hinduism/</guid>
      <description>Introduction There is no such thing as Hinduism. And yet, of course, there is.
The origins of this religion can be traced back in two ways - the word itself goes back to the time of the Greeks, when it was used to describe anyone (of any religious tradition) who lived east of the Indus river. In that sense, Hindus are a geographic group, not a religious one.
The word &amp;lsquo;Hindu&amp;rsquo; found additional utility during the time of British colonisation in India, when it was used to group together the country’s diverse religious traditions - this was largely a result of the Western religious framework, which expected to see neatly compartmentalised religions with texts, beliefs, and practices, but which did not really suit the dynamic range of religious identity and expression found outside of Europe.</description>

      <description>Introduction There is no god but God, and Muhammad is his messenger. This is the core concept of Islam, a monotheistic tradition that emerged in the 7th century in Arabia, and which traces its roots back to the one god of the Hebrews. Muhammad began to receive messages from the one god (Allah) in his later life, and these were memorised, written, and eventually compiled into a single book called the Qur’an (Arabic for the recitation).</description>

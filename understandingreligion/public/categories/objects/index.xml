      <description>Introduction Murtis are believed to be places of residence for the gods, who are installed in the murti during a ceremony (known as the prana pratishtha (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prana_Pratishtha)), and thereafter treated exactly the same as the deity would be treated, including feeding, bathing, and dressing them.
 A murti becomes venerable for Hindus only after it is enlivened with the spiritual energy and essence of the Deity. Because it contains the living presence of the Deity, a murti is more than a physical representation or a meditational tool.</description>

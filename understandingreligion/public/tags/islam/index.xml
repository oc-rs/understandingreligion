      <guid>https://www.understandingreligion.org.uk/p/six-articles/</guid>
      <description>The Islamic principle of Iman, or faith, is composed of six items, which Muslims are expected to believe in order to live a devout life:
 Allah - the existence of one god, who alone created and sustains the universe Angels - messengers of Allah who can communicate with humanity Holy Books - the scriptures, including the Qur&amp;rsquo;an but also elements of the Tanakh (Hebrew Bible) and the message preached by Isa (Jesus) Prophets - the messengers and prophets of Allah who came before Muhammad Day of Judgement - a day on which Allah will assess the character of each person and either send them to heaven or hell Predestination - Allah knows everything that will happen, although the common view is that humans still have free will to make choices  References to these six articles of faith are frequently made in Islamic publications - for example, take a look at this information page from the Enfield Islamic Centre&amp;rsquo;s website and see if you can find where the articles are mentioned: http://www.</description>

Muhammad began to receive messages from the one god (Allah) in his later life, and these were memorised, written, and eventually compiled into a single book called the Qurâ€™an (Arabic for the recitation).</description>

      <description>Introduction A figure of Indian independence against British rule, Gandhi was a revered Hindu activist.
Controversial Practices There are several elements of Mohandas Gandhi&amp;rsquo;s life that have led to disagreement and controversy, both during his life and after; of particular interest are the conflicted perceptions of his Hinduism and Hindu identity.
Gandhi&amp;rsquo;s particular expression of spirituality was rooted in the Hindu traditions of his family, but he also gained exposure to a variety of other religious systems, and his attitudes towards Muslims and other minority groups (for example widows, and those in the Dalit caste) did not align with many in his society (Beckerlegge, 2013, pp.</description>

      <title>The Pañcadaśī</title>
      <link>https://www.understandingreligion.org.uk/p/pa%C3%B1cada%C5%9B%C4%AB/</link>

      <description>Introduction The Pañcadaśī is a Hindu philosophical text, in the tradition of advaita vedanta, also known as non-dualism.
The meaning of ‘advaita’ is found in the word itself: a meaning not (just like in English if we say that someone is an atheist or atypical) and dvaita meaning dual. The duality referred to by this term is not just one duality, but all dualities, all apparent separation and distinction. In simple terms we might say that the advaitic position is: ‘all things are really one thing’, or ‘it’s all one’.</description>

      <description>Introduction Murtis are believed to be places of residence for the gods, who are installed in the murti during a ceremony (known as the prana pratishtha (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prana_Pratishtha)), and thereafter treated exactly the same as the deity would be treated, including feeding, bathing, and dressing them.
 A murti becomes venerable for Hindus only after it is enlivened with the spiritual energy and essence of the Deity. Because it contains the living presence of the Deity, a murti is more than a physical representation or a meditational tool.</description>

      <description>Introduction  Developed by Dr. Brian Black, Text Talks provides teachers and students (and anyone else whoâ€™s interested) with weekly podcasts and resources based around the GCSE and A Level Syllabuses for Buddhism and Hinduism.
Dr. Black works with Alex Owens and Katie Work, two PhD Students based at Lancaster University, to produce these resources.

      <description>Introduction Buddhism is a family of traditions which trace their lineage back to a figure known as Siddartha Gautama, a man who discovered a means of escape from the suffering of existence. It is said that he became &amp;lsquo;awakened&amp;rsquo;, and this is the meaning of his title: Buddha.
Broadly speaking, Buddhists follow the Four Noble Truths, as expressed by the Buddha:
 Life is unsatisfactory (dukkha) This unsatisfactoriness has a singular cause (samudaya) This cause can be stopped (nirodha) Buddhism is the way to stop it (magga)  The precise nature of the underlying cause, the way that unsatisfactoriness manifests, and other key details have been the subject of many Buddhist scriptures, which claim to relate what Gautama, also known by his title of the Awakened One (Buddha), said on these matters.</description>

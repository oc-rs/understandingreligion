      <description>Introduction Buddhism is a family of traditions which trace their lineage back to a figure known as Siddartha Gautama, a man who discovered a means of escape from the suffering of existence. It is said that he became &amp;lsquo;awakened&amp;rsquo;, and this is the meaning of his title: Buddha.
Broadly speaking, Buddhists follow the Four Noble Truths, as expressed by the Buddha:
 Suffering exists Suffering has a cause, craving / desire Suffering has an end, if craving is stopped The Noble Eightfold Path is the route to the cessation of suffering  Although most Buddhists would agree that these principles are true, how they follow the Buddha’s teachings, and their relationship to other teachers and entities is very diverse.</description>

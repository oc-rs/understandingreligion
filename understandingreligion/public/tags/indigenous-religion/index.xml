      <description>Introduction  Robin Horton (1932 - 2019), an English social anthropologist and philosopher, has carried out specialised study in comparative religion since the 1950s which has challenged and expanded views in the study of the anthropology of religion. He is notable for his comparison of traditional thought systems (including religion) to Western science.

      <description>Introduction The seven dimensions of religion are a framework for exploring and understanding religion, developed by the Scottish scholar of religion, Ninian Smart.
Smart&amp;rsquo;s approach sidestepped the issue of agreeing on what counted as &amp;lsquo;a religion&amp;rsquo;, and instead identified types of experience and expression that were demonstrably religious or spiritual in nature.
This modular approach to religious studies facilitated a much broader scope to consider and compare spiritual traditions and artefacts from around the world that may not have aligned with a Western conception of what a religion was.</description>

      <description>Introduction Smart was a Scottish writer and educator who developed the field of academic religious studies, and helped to distance it from theology. He took the investigation away from which religion was &amp;lsquo;true&amp;rsquo;, and instead looked at the lived experiences of religious adherents.
Smart identified seven categories that could be used to break up the study of religion into focused areas; he called these the seven dimensions of religion.

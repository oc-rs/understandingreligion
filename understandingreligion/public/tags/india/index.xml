      <description>Introduction The Jain religious tradition focuses on liberation from the suffering of rebirth, and in this sense has common ground with its near geographic neighbours - Hinduism and Buddhism. For Jains, karma is an accretion of negative energy, collected over many lives - like pollen clinging to the legs of a bee. The goal of human life is to shed this karma, and once free from it, achieve supreme liberation - moksha.</description>

      <description>Introduction A figure of Indian independence against British rule, Gandhi was a revered Hindu activist.
Controversial Practices There are several elements of Mohandas Gandhi&amp;rsquo;s life that have led to disagreement and controversy, both during his life and after; of particular interest are the conflicted perceptions of his Hinduism and Hindu identity.
Gandhi&amp;rsquo;s particular expression of spirituality was rooted in the Hindu traditions of his family, but he also gained exposure to a variety of other religious systems, and his attitudes towards Muslims and other minority groups (for example widows, and those in the Dalit caste) did not align with many in his society (Beckerlegge, 2013, pp.</description>

      <title>Mahayana Buddhism</title>

      <guid>https://www.understandingreligion.org.uk/p/mahayana-buddhism/</guid>
      <description>Introduction Mahayana is a form of Buddhism that includes many divergent traditions spread over a geographically and culturally diverse area, but can be summarised as a religion where compassion for others is the principal virtue. For Mahayanists, the aspirational figure is the bodhisattva: one who delays their own salvation in order to help others achieve liberation first.</description>

      <guid>https://www.understandingreligion.org.uk/p/theravada-buddhism/</guid>
      <description>Introduction Theravada is a form of Buddhism that claims to represent an historically accurate version of Buddhism, which venerates the Buddha but does not deify him, follows the teachings of the old scriptures (the Pali Canon), and values the aspirational figure of the arhat: the liberated individual who finds freedom by strength of will.</description>

      <title>Ramayana</title>

      <description>Introduction The Ramayana (literally Rama&amp;rsquo;s travels) is about the character Rama, prince of a kingdom called Ayodhya (and later its king), but Rama is actually the god Vishnu who has taken birth in a human form, or avatar. The word should be familiar to internet users, who often have an online avatar to represent them, and of course the film by the same name uses a similar idea of becoming embodied and represented by a form not belonging to one&amp;rsquo;s true self.</description>

      <title>Siddhārtha Gautama (Buddha)</title>
      <link>https://www.understandingreligion.org.uk/p/gautama-buddha/</link>

      <guid>https://www.understandingreligion.org.uk/p/gautama-buddha/</guid>
      <description>Introduction Siddhārtha Gautama was born as a prince of a region called Kapilavastu (southern Nepal by today&amp;rsquo;s borders), sometime between the 6th and 4th centuries before the common era (BCE). As a prince, he was raised in a household of wealth and joy. It was not until his late twenties that he encountered suffering, finally witnessing the reality of sickness, old age, and death.
Committed to discovering a solution to these issues, he adopted the life of a monk, and symbolically cut off his long hair.</description>

      <title>Buddhism</title>
      <link>https://www.understandingreligion.org.uk/p/buddhism/</link>

      <guid>https://www.understandingreligion.org.uk/p/buddhism/</guid>
      <description>Introduction Buddhism is a family of traditions which trace their lineage back to a figure known as Siddartha Gautama, a man who discovered a means of escape from the suffering of existence. It is said that he became &amp;lsquo;awakened&amp;rsquo;, and this is the meaning of his title: Buddha.
Broadly speaking, Buddhists follow the Four Noble Truths, as expressed by the Buddha:
 Life is unsatisfactory (dukkha) This unsatisfactoriness has a singular cause (samudaya) This cause can be stopped (nirodha) Buddhism is the way to stop it (magga)  The precise nature of the underlying cause, the way that unsatisfactoriness manifests, and other key details have been the subject of many Buddhist scriptures, which claim to relate what Gautama, also known by his title of the Awakened One (Buddha), said on these matters.</description>

      <title>Hinduism</title>
      <link>https://www.understandingreligion.org.uk/p/hinduism/</link>

      <guid>https://www.understandingreligion.org.uk/p/hinduism/</guid>
      <description>Introduction There is no such thing as Hinduism. And yet, of course, there is.
The origins of this religion can be traced back in two ways - the word itself goes back to the time of the Greeks, when it was used to describe anyone (of any religious tradition) who lived east of the Indus river. In that sense, Hindus are a geographic group, not a religious one.
The word &amp;lsquo;Hindu&amp;rsquo; found additional utility during the time of British colonisation in India, when it was used to group together the country’s diverse religious traditions - this was largely a result of the Western religious framework, which expected to see neatly compartmentalised religions with texts, beliefs, and practices, but which did not really suit the dynamic range of religious identity and expression found outside of Europe.</description>

      <description>Introduction  What is meant by &amp;ldquo;rejected&amp;rdquo; in Rejected Religion? Put simply, it&amp;rsquo;s everything that has been considered &amp;lsquo;heretical&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;forbidden&amp;rsquo; by the dominant religions throughout Western history. Think of terms such as &amp;lsquo;the occult&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;the esoteric&amp;rsquo; and all that can be located in that area - magical practices such as witchcraft; alternate worldviews such as Satanism; systems such as astrology and tarot; the use of hallucinogenic substances for &amp;lsquo;spiritual&amp;rsquo; growth; or well-known people such as Aleister Crowley &amp;ndash; this is just a small sample of the larger &amp;lsquo;esoteric&amp;rsquo; category that this platform addresses.</description>

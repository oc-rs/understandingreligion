      <description>Introduction To claim that a location, structure, or geographical feature is sacred is to assert that it is &amp;lsquo;&amp;hellip;set apart and regarded with special reverence&amp;hellip;&amp;rsquo; (Wolffe, 2017(a), p.213). Yet there are many ways to understand this sacrality, where it comes from, and how it is expressed by different groups of people. The term sacred has a strong religious association, and usually means that something serves a religious function, or holds importance for people by virtue of its religious associations (Oxford University Press, 2017).</description>

      <description>Introduction  This is a recording of &amp;lsquo;What are worldviews and why should schools teach them?&amp;rsquo; on 21st October 2020.
How RE is taught in schools is a central pillar of any society’s religious literacy, challenging false assumptions and expanding young minds to consider the role of religion and belief in a modern world. In 2018, the Commission on Religious Education launched new proposals for a paradigm shift in the subject, broadening the focus of RE in English schools to a consideration of “Religion and Worldviews”.</description>

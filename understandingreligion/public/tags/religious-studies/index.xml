      <title>Similarity and Difference in the Study of Religion</title>
      <link>https://www.understandingreligion.org.uk/p/similarity-and-difference/</link>

      <description>In religious studies, scholars sometime swing between two extremes. Those who look for similarity in different religions lean towards the idea of a perennial philosophy – a recurring, innately human spirituality that exists prior to culture, and is then sculpted by it. Wherever you find religious expression, they would argue, if you chip away the surface labels, you&amp;rsquo;ll find the same basic experiences.
A well-known proponent of this idea was Mircea Eliade, who claimed that religious systems were windows onto the sacred, a non-normal aspect to reality which occasionally could be glimpsed, or else might break through in the form of a hierophany (literally: a divine revelation).</description>

      <description>As we enter the world of religious studies, we do so as conditioned individuals, with our own background and history, as well as the inherited values of the society within which we were raised. We cannot &amp;lsquo;get rid&amp;rsquo; of these aspects of ourselves (nor should we!), but we should try to remain aware of them.
We should also be aware that within the field of religious studies itself, we may encounter an underlying tendency to view religion as a set of beliefs, guided by canonical literature, and though beliefs and texts are common features, they are certainly not the whole story!</description>

      <description>Introduction The OCRS was founded by Luke Burns in 2016 as a way to help provide access to information about religious ideas and practices from around the world.
 I wanted to learn about different perspectives and experiences of the unseen, but struggled to find a place online that offered this information in a clear and accessible format. I imagined creating an organisation that would provide this knowledge, and little by little tried to bring it into existence.</description>

      <title>Seven Dimensions of Religion</title>
      <link>https://www.understandingreligion.org.uk/p/seven-dimensions-of-religion/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 15 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.understandingreligion.org.uk/p/seven-dimensions-of-religion/</guid>
      <description>Introduction The seven dimensions of religion are a framework for exploring and understanding religion, developed by the Scottish scholar of religion, Ninian Smart.
Smart&amp;rsquo;s approach sidestepped the issue of agreeing on what counted as &amp;lsquo;a religion&amp;rsquo;, and instead identified types of experience and expression that were demonstrably religious or spiritual in nature.
This modular approach to religious studies facilitated a much broader scope to consider and compare spiritual traditions and artefacts from around the world that may not have aligned with a Western conception of what a religion was.</description>

      <title>What is religious studies?</title>
      <link>https://www.understandingreligion.org.uk/p/what-is-religious-studies/</link>

      <guid>https://www.understandingreligion.org.uk/p/what-is-religious-studies/</guid>
      <description>Introduction Religious studies is the academic study of religion - but what does that really mean?
It means that we use scholarly tools and techniques to investigate what religion is, how it&amp;rsquo;s performed, why it exists, and what it means for the people who practice it.
It also means looking critically at how we build up our picture of ‘religion’ - who gets to define the category? What does it include, and what does it leave out?</description>

      <guid>https://www.understandingreligion.org.uk/p/who-creates-religion/</guid>
      <description>Introduction The modern study of religion, beginning in the 19th Century, has been traditionally driven by male European scholars, who have carried their own cultural biases and assumptions - some unconscious, others less so.
Until recently, there had been little awareness of these assumptions, and this had affected the ideas and methods used by academics; naturally we will have to negotiate some of these potential pitfalls if we want to build a more comprehensive and accurate picture of religion in the modern world.</description>

      <guid>https://www.understandingreligion.org.uk/p/world-religions-paradigm/</guid>
      <description>Introduction When the category of religion is used to describe &amp;lsquo;world religions&amp;rsquo;, it is often in a way that turns multiple diverse traditions, philosophies, and practices, into one single entity for the sake of simplicity.
A good example of this is Hinduism, which is a label coined by the British to describe the religion of the Indian people.
The hidden diversity of Hinduism
Hinduism did not exist in the language of the Indian peoples (in fact there are many languages in use on the Indian subcontinent); it was a label applied by British observers.</description>

      <description>Introduction  What is meant by &amp;ldquo;rejected&amp;rdquo; in Rejected Religion? Put simply, it&amp;rsquo;s everything that has been considered &amp;lsquo;heretical&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;forbidden&amp;rsquo; by the dominant religions throughout Western history. Think of terms such as &amp;lsquo;the occult&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;the esoteric&amp;rsquo; and all that can be located in that area - magical practices such as witchcraft; alternate worldviews such as Satanism; systems such as astrology and tarot; the use of hallucinogenic substances for &amp;lsquo;spiritual&amp;rsquo; growth; or well-known people such as Aleister Crowley &amp;ndash; this is just a small sample of the larger &amp;lsquo;esoteric&amp;rsquo; category that this platform addresses.</description>

      <title>What is religious literacy?</title>
      <link>https://www.understandingreligion.org.uk/p/what-is-religious-literacy/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 26 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.understandingreligion.org.uk/p/what-is-religious-literacy/</guid>
      <description>Religious literacy is a term that has become more popular in recent years, but what exactly do we mean when we talk about it?
The word &amp;lsquo;literacy&amp;rsquo; definitely sounds like it has something to do with reading and understanding written texts - religious traditions will often (but not always!) write things down, so is religious literacy the ability to read these texts?
Nope!
Just like how being able to read is a skill that you can apply throughout your life, religious literacy is a skill that allows you to understand and interpret religious phenomena wherever you encounter them.</description>

      <title>Alternative Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://www.understandingreligion.org.uk/p/alternative-perspectives/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 25 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.understandingreligion.org.uk/p/alternative-perspectives/</guid>
      <description>Introduction Alternative perspectives, due to their absence in mainstream texts and dismissal by historical scholars, are sometimes difficult to hear over the sound of traditional narratives – but this is increasingly changing for the better. Where we can open ourselves to these voices, we can improve our understanding of the history of religion, but also our understanding of contemporary religious practitioners as well.
Feminism in religion Female academic perspectives on religious literature, contesting or challenging male interpretations, have been developing over a long period of time.</description>

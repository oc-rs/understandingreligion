      <description>Introduction Religious literacy is a term that has become more popular in recent years, but what exactly do we mean when we talk about it?
The word &amp;lsquo;literacy&amp;rsquo; definitely sounds like it has something to do with reading and understanding written texts - religious traditions will often (but not always!) write things down, so is religious literacy the ability to read these texts?
Nope!
Just like how being able to read is a skill that you can apply throughout your life, religious literacy is a skill that allows you to understand and interpret religious phenomena wherever you encounter them.</description>

      <description>Introduction  Since the 1980s, American Buddhist convert communities have been the site of reoccurring cases of sexual abuse and misconduct. This two-part presentation will reflect on how some contemporary practitioners have responded, in particular identifying &amp;ldquo;generative responses&amp;rdquo; that combine Buddhist and non-Buddhist frameworks to generate new forms of Buddhist thought, community, and practice. Taking a constructive rather than a corrective approach, it will then consider these responses in relationship to the Buddhist sexual ethics found in classical sources, focusing especially on the ideas of consent and intention.</description>

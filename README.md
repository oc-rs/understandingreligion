# Understanding Religion | an OCRS project
[understandingreligion.org.uk](https://www.understandingreligion.org.uk)

Understanding Religion is a website aimed at providing clean and simple access to information relating to the study of religion. Always free, written clearly for a wide audience, grounded in academic study and supported by references for those who want to dive deeper.

The project is developed by the Online Centre for Religious Studies (https://oc-rs.org)

The site is broken into sections: each section will have a title and subtitle, along with a short summary explaining the basics. Within each section there will also be information pages - for example within the 'Figures' section you will have articles on Lao Tzu, Mother Theresa, and Guru Gobind Singh.

Each article will contain an 'abstract' or short summary, roughly explaining the key points - it will then go into more detail throughout the article, but always with a view to being understood by a wide audience.

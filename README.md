# Understanding Religion | an OCRS project
[understandingreligion.org.uk](https://www.understandingreligion.org.uk)

Understanding Religion is a website aimed at providing clean and simple access to information relating to the study of religion. Always free, written clearly for a wide audience, grounded in academic study and supported by references for those who want to dive deeper.

The project is developed by the Online Centre for Religious Studies (https://oc-rs.org)

The site is broken into sections: each section will have a title and subtitle, along with a short summary explaining the basics. Within each section there will also be information pages - for example within the 'Figures' section you will have articles on Lao Tzu, Mother Theresa, and Guru Gobind Singh.

Each article will contain an 'abstract' or short summary, roughly explaining the key points - it will then go into more detail throughout the article, but always with a view to being understood by a wide audience.

The unique aspect of this site will be the way that it groups together these articles (or pages) into meaningful journeys (books).

Any page might belong to several books, and occur at different places in different books depending on that book's focus.

At the bottom of each page you will see which book(s) you are currently within, and have the option to move forward, backwards, or return to the book's homepage. You might start by reading a book about Catholicism, but after reading the section on the early church find yourself drawn into a different book on Gnosticism (which would naturally cross over at certain points with the Catholicism book). While reading the Gnosticism book you might decide to branch into a book on religious experience, and from there into the neurological study of religion, reductionism, and evolutionary biology!

This structure, where many paths meet and intertwine allows the reader to follow their own impulses, and rewards inquistiveness without forcing the reader into a narrow learning avenue leading to a dead-end.
